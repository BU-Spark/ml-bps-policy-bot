Insulin is a hormone produced by the \npancreas that is needed to convert sugar and starches into \nenergy for the body.  People with diabetes have increased blood \nglucose (sugar) levels because they lack or have insufficient \ninsulin or are resistant to insulin’s effects. High levels of glucose \nbuild up in the blood and spill into the urine; as a result the body \nloses its main source of fuel."
