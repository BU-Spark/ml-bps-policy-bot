**Research Papers**

1\. *LLaMa-SciQ: An Educational Chatbot for Answering Science MCQ*  
[*https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16779*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16779)

* **Fine-Tuning for Domain Accuracy**: LLaMa-SciQ fine-tunes its language model on science-related multiple-choice questions (MCQs), improving accuracy and relevance. This approach helps the chatbot understand and respond to domain-specific queries effectively.  
* **Direct Preference Optimization and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**: The paper uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to tailor responses based on user preferences and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to break down complex questions into step-by-step answers, enhancing the chatbot's ability to deliver clear and detailed explanations.

2\. *Paper 2: Developing a Llama-Based Chatbot for CI/CD Question Answering: A Case Study at Ericsson*  
[*https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09277*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09277)

* **Domain-Specific Corpus and Preprocessing:** Extract and preprocess school policy documents to ensure accurate retrieval of relevant information for legal and administrative queries.  
* **RAG and Query Rewriting:** Implement RAG and query rewriting to retrieve comprehensive policy answers and clarify vague user queries for accuracy.

3\. *Paper 3: FACTS About Building Retrieval Augmented Generation-based Chatbots*  
[*https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07858*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07858)

* **Hybrid Search Integration**: Combining lexical and vector-based search methods improves chatbot accuracy and relevance for retrieving school policy documents efficiently.  
* **Agentic Architectures for Complex Queries**: Implementing agentic architectures enables the chatbot to decompose multifaceted queries, providing precise, context-aware answers for policy-related questions*.*

**Open source Project:**

1. RAG Chatbot:  
   [https://github.com/umbertogriffo/rag-chatbot](https://github.com/umbertogriffo/rag-chatbot)  
* **RAG and Memory Indexing**: Implementing RAG with memory indexing allows for faster, more accurate retrieval of relevant school policy document sections.  
* **Context Handling for Complex Queries**: Using hierarchical summarization and refinement techniques enables the chatbot to manage complex queries across multiple policy documents efficiently.
