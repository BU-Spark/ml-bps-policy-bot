Version 01 
 
POLICY ON USE OF BPS BUILDINGS & FACILITIES FOR 
POLITICAL PURPOSES 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
 
All building administrators and managers of facilities within the 
Boston Public School Department should be aware of the Boston 
Public Schools’ policy on the use of its facilities for political 
purposes.  
No Boston Public School facility may be used for predominantly 
political activity, such as activities in support of political 
candidates or ballot questions.  
Any use of a Boston Public School facility for a predominantly 
governmental activity with an incidental political activity overlap, 
such as those activities related to education laws, funding, or 
policies, but not related to specific teaching or learning at a 
particular school, may only occur with prior notification to and 
specific approval from the superintendent or their designee. 
Examples of such activities might include the signing of 
education legislation, the announcement of educational policies 
or results, or announcements of receipt of grants or other funds. 
These examples demonstrate activities in furtherance of the 
purpose for which governmental funds have been appropriated 
to Boston Public Schools, with an incidental political activity

superintendent or their designee is an unauthorized use and 
should be considered an “unwarranted privilege” for the 
purposes of the Massachusetts Conflict of Interest Law.

please see Superintendent’s Circular LGL-09 Political Activity by 
Public Employees.
