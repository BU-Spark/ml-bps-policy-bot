Circular 
NUMBER: 
LGL-06 
Version 01 
 
RELIGIOUS HOLY DAYS 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or suspended 
by a subsequent version. 
 
It is the policy of the Boston Public Schools to make reasonable 
efforts to accommodate the religious beliefs of students and 
staff.  State and federal laws also mandate such reasonable 
accommodations. 
Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 151C, Section 2B reads, in 
pertinent part, as follows: 
“Any student in an educational or vocational training 
institution, other than a religious or denominational 
educational or vocational training institution, who is unable, 
because of [their] religious beliefs, to attend classes or to 
participate in any examination, study, or work requirement 
on a particular day shall be excused from any such 
examination or study or work requirement, and shall be 
provided with an opportunity to make up such examination, 
study, or work requirement which [they] may have missed 
because of such absence on any particular day; provided, 
however, that such makeup examination or work shall not 
create an unreasonable burden upon such school. No fees of 
any kind shall be charged by the institution for making 
available to the said student such opportunity. No adverse

or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of 
[their] availing [themselves] of the provisions of this section.” 
To accommodate the religious beliefs of students, all who 
observe any holiday because of religious beliefs should be 
marked “constructively present” upon submitting a valid note 
from a parent or guardian (see Circular ACA-18).  In addition, 
teachers should refrain from giving tests on these religious 
holidays and allow sufficient time for these students to make up 
their work before administering tests.
