NUMBER: 
CAO-23 
Version 01 
 
DAY FIELD TRIP GUIDELINES 
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: *These guidelines might be impacted by 
COVID-19 restrictions and are subject to change based on public 
health, international security, or other emergent issues that could 
impact travel.  For the most up-to-date information and 
guidance, contact the Department of Global Education 
(OPL@bostonpublicschools.org) for assistance/guidance.  
This Superintendent’s Circular provides instructions for 
implementing the Field Trip Policy passed by the Boston School 
Committee on November 20, 2019. 
This circular should be read AFTER Superintendent’s Circular 
CAO-22 General Guidelines and Procedures for All Field Trips, as 
additional guidelines are outlined there.  
The principal/head of school (and/or the district department 
sponsoring the trip) is responsible for ensuring that all field trip 
policies and procedures as outlined in this circular and CAO-22 
are adhered to.  
Together, the principal/head of school (and/or the district 
department lead sponsoring the trip) and the program leader 
(lead chaperone) must review and complete checklists for this 
circular. The signed checklist must be kept on file at the school.

A day field trip is any domestic trip off school grounds that is no 
more than one day in duration.  
 Day field trip forms are submitted to the principal/head of 
school AT LEAST 4 weeks in advance (or at the 
principal/head of school ’s discretion) and approved by the 
principal/head of school; school leaders reserve the right to 
cancel a trip for any reason and at any time for safety 
purposes. 
 Walking field trips are day field trips that require walking 
within a 1-mile radius of the school (e.g., local garden, park, 
field, etc.) The Parent/Guardian Authorization and 
Acknowledgement of Risks for Walking Trips form will apply 
for all walking field trips during the current school year. It 
must be updated each school year or as student/family 
information changes. The school is still required to inform 
families in advance of each walking field trip and obtain 
approval from the principal/head of school. All forms, 
including signed CAO-23 checklist form, are filed at the 
school. 
Applications: Schools shall communicate with families in 
advance when students leave school grounds and ensure written 
permission is received. 
Water Activities:  Organizers of trips that involve activities in or 
on the water as part of the curriculum must immediately contact 
the Department of Global Education for additional approval. 
There is a separate and mandatory procedure for all trips 
involving water. See Superintendent’s Circular CAO-27 for water 
activity guidelines.

DAY FIELD TRIP CHECKLIST  
(Checklist and request form must be completed for each day 
field trip.) 
 Review Superintendent’s Circular CAO-22 General 
Guidelines and Procedures for All Field Trips. 
 Review Superintendent’s Circular FSE-05 Medical 
Emergency Management and SAF-04 Incident Data 
Reporting and Release for important safety protocols. The 
Department of Safety Services (617-635-8000) must be 
notified in the event of a serious emergency and should be 
used as a resource for questions regarding safety on field 
trips. 
 Select a site and investigate the appropriateness of the site 
in relation to the category of field trip. 
Field Trip Category(s) (see CAO-22):  _______________________  
Site(s): ____________________________________________________  
 Select a date and an alternate date. Note: Check with the 
principal/head of school, teachers, and staff to ensure that 
trips are not scheduled on dates that interfere with 
important tests, religious holidays, or class work. 
 
 
Date:  _____________________________________________________  
Alternate Date: ___________________________________________  
 All program leaders (the BPS employee organizing and 
leading the trip) must be approved by the principal/head of 
school or district department sponsoring the trip. 
 All field trip ideas must be preliminarily approved in writing 
by the principal/head of school or district department 


Page 4:

Page 4 of 36 
 
sponsoring the trip prior to the distribution of any 
informational materials on the proposed trip to students 
and their parents/guardians, and prior to any fundraising or 
other detailed preparations. Staff are not allowed to sign 
contracts on behalf of the Boston Public Schools. Consult 
with the principal/head of school on potential chaperones 
and student recruitment.  
 Planning, organization, and preparation are critical to a 
successful experience for all participants. As part of trip 
planning and itinerary development, ensure the major 
aspects of health, safety, student inclusion, and security 
have been addressed with due diligence. Program leaders 
must be able to articulate what decisions were made, why 
they were made, and the sources that informed that 
decision making. If you have questions about the 
appropriateness of an activity, please consult with your 
principal/head of school.  
 School nurse and guidance counselor consultation: Before 
approval of a field trip, the lead chaperone must consult 
with the school leader to determine if and what type of 
medical assistance is needed for participating students. To 
ensure accessibility, this step is crucial and must take place 
before the field trip is secured. For additional questions, 
please consult the Health Services Department. Additionally, 
to thoroughly support a student's participation in a field trip, 
at least six weeks before departure (much longer for 
international and overnight field trip programs), consult 
with and, when necessary, receive training from the school 
nurse regarding any students who have medical needs. Also 
consult with the school counselor regarding mental and 
behavioral health needs. If any student has a serious 
medical or mental health condition, be sure that their 


Page 5:
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-23 
Page 5 of 36 
 
doctor is aware of the essential participation criteria and 
location of the trip and writes a letter indicating that the 
child may safely attend and participate in trip activities. 
Keep this document on file with other key permissions slips 
and medical forms. 
CHAPERONE REQUIREMENTS 
 Chaperone Recruitment: Program leaders must consult 
with the principal/head of school regarding potential 
chaperones and student recruitment. The program leader 
(lead chaperone) must be a BPS employee. Other 
authorized chaperones may include parents and guardians 
21 years of age or older. Any parent on the trip must operate 
in the role of chaperone. All chaperones must be approved 
by the head of school/principal. Every effort should be made 
for students to have access to the field trip experience, for 
chaperones to be representative of the student group, and 
for chaperones to include males and females. The selection 
and approval of chaperones by the principal/head of school 
should be based on the individuals’ thorough knowledge of 
and rapport with most of the student participants. Choose a 
chaperone team purposefully and wisely, considering 
strengths. Every adult on the trip must be a chaperone and 
have a clear role. 
 Non-BPS Chaperones: Other authorized chaperones may 
include parents and volunteers who are 21 years of age or 
older. All non-BPS employee chaperones must submit a 
yearly CORI/SORI authorization form to the Office of Human 
Capital. Complete the eCORI form. Contact the BPS Office of 
Human Capital (OHC) for CORI check and confirmation 
support. The principal/head of school and the lead 
chaperone are responsible for submitting authorization 


Page 6:
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-23 
Page 6 of 36 
 
forms to OHC and must not allow chaperones to take part in 
activities until they have been CORI/SORI cleared. Non-BPS 
employees who chaperone on a field trip are not covered for 
liability by the Boston Public Schools. The program leader 
must be sure that all chaperones, including non-BPS 
chaperones, are familiar with the BPS Code of Conduct and 
other district and school-based rules.  
 BPS Parent Chaperones: Chaperones who are 
parents/guardians of BPS students on the trip must provide 
the same level of care and attention to ALL student 
participants. If a BPS chaperone’s child who does not attend 
the participating school must attend the program, the child 
must be a BPS student and in the same grade or age range 
as participating students. In this case, the BPS parent 
chaperone is responsible for incurring all costs associated 
with their child’s participation.  
 All chaperones must complete the Chaperone Agreement 
form.  
Chaperone Ratios:  
• A minimum of two chaperones is required.  
• Student-to-chaperone ratios are: 
o Grades K-5, 10:1   
o Grades 6 and up, 10:1 
• For students with IEPs, the ratio of staff to students must be 
at least the same as the ratio mandated in their IEPs for 
their classes. 
• For water activities: The student-to-chaperone ratio must 
remain 10:1 at all times during instructional swimming for all 
grade levels. This ratio does not include lifeguards on duty. If 
your trip involves activities on or in the water, you must 


Page 7:
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-23 
Page 7 of 36 
 
contact the Department of Global Education for approval 
immediately. There is a separate, mandatory procedure for 
all trips involving water. See Superintendent’s Circular CAO-
27 for water activity guidelines. 
Chaperone Team: 
 The program leader/lead chaperone will meet with the 
chaperone team to delegate responsibilities and review the 
student team. The program leader will record the names of 
the chaperones and the students each chaperone is 
supervising. Each chaperone must carry this list. 
 Chaperones will organize a “buddy system,” pairing 
students with one another for safety purposes. 
 The lead chaperone will (1) review students’ permission slips; 
and (2) prepare any questions for follow-up with families 
and the school nurse and counselor.  
 The lead chaperone will prepare a trip binder for all 
chaperones (See “During the Trip” section which lists all 
binder contents).  
 The lead chaperone must carry original, signed Parental 
Authorization for Day Trip forms for all students; all other 
chaperones must carry copies. 
STUDENT PARTICIPATION 
 Participation Criteria: The program leader and 
principal/head of school will work together to establish (1) 
essential participation criteria for the trip that informs 
students and parents of all activities and risks associated 
with each itinerary activity; and (2) trip location, to 
determine what accommodations or modifications may 


Page 8:
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-23 
Page 8 of 36 
 
need to be made for the student to successfully and safely 
participation in all, or portions of the trip. Discuss with 
students the trip’s purpose and learning goals in the weeks 
prior to the trip; plan to engage students in activities before, 
during, and after the trip so that the field trip learning 
potential is maximized. Set aside time to process student 
learning on the trip.  
 Recruitment: Students not enrolled in the Boston Public 
Schools may not participate. Field trips must be advertised 
to all students (within the whole school, particular grade, 
class/subject, club, or program associated with the trip) 
regardless of their financial situation. Schools shall make 
every reasonable effort to make instructional field trips 
affordable for all students.  
 Accommodations: English Learners and students with 504 
Plans and/or IEPs cannot be denied access to field trips due 
to their status or ability. It is the responsibility of the school 
to ensure that all accommodations normally provided to a 
student as indicated in their educational plans are made 
available during a field trip, including medication. To 
thoroughly support a student's participation in a field trip, at 
least six weeks before departure, consult with, and when 
necessary, receive training from (1) the school nurse 
regarding any students who have medical needs; and (2) the 
school counselor regarding mental and behavioral health 
needs. If any student has a serious medical condition, please 
be sure that their doctor writes a letter indicating that the 
child may safely attend and participate in trip activities. 
Ensure the availability of a first aid kit. 
 Inclusivity: Program leaders must consider their student 
demographics when selecting field trip locations, sites, and 


Page 9:
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-23 
Page 9 of 36 
 
activities. Specifically determine the impact the locations, 
sites, and activities may have on diverse populations such as 
students of color, EL students, students who identify with 
the LGBTQIA+ community, students with disabilities, those 
who may be in the minority during your field trip 
experience, and those students who belong to groups that 
have experienced marginalization in the location being 
visited. Program leaders must work to prepare students for 
sensitive experiences and ensure that the program is safe 
and inclusive for all students.  
 Inclusive Accommodations: The program leader and 
principal/head of school will work with transgender and 
gender nonconforming students to provide 
accommodations (including rooming) that affirm the 
student’s gender identity while also ensuring safety. 
Program leaders should work with students and families to 
make sure all travel documents reflect their legal names as 
listed on government issued identification, while all 
unofficial documents and materials may reflect the 
student’s preferred name.  
 The BPS Code of Conduct applies on all field trips. Review 
conduct expectations with students in advance. 
DOCUMENTATION 
 Consult with the principal/head of school and nurse 
regarding the medical needs of potential participating 
students before you receive field trip approval (at least six 
weeks beforehand). Document notes from this consultation. 
 Complete and submit a Day Field Trip Request form and 
accompanying documents to obtain official consent from 
the principal/head of school to execute the trip.  


Page 10:
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-23 
Page 10 of 36 
 
 Create a school file to house all important documents: Day 
Field Trip Request form, student permission slips, and other 
signed documents. These documents must be kept on file 
for the current fiscal year plus three additional years after 
the trip has occurred. 
 Distribute and collect the Parental Authorization for Day 
Trip form for each participating student. 
 Contact the field trip site and ensure that the necessary 
arrangements are in place. 
 Share the trip details listed below with all teachers and 
other staff members so that they may plan accordingly:  
o Trip overview (purpose); destination; date of trip; roster 
o Chaperones’ names and roles in school community 
 Inform the food service manager or attendant whether 
students will return to school for lunch, or whether brown 
bag lunches should be prepared. Be mindful of any student 
food allergies. 
TRANSPORTATION  
 Develop transportation plans: mode of transportation, travel 
time, cost, etc. If applicable, be sure to note how and with 
whom the child will travel to and from field trip departure 
and pick-up locations. 
 Staff are not permitted to drive students. Privately owned 
vehicles from non-approved vendors, ride sharing services 
such as Lyft or Uber, or leased vehicles are not to be utilized 
except in the case of a bona fide emergency. Staff who 
utilize their own vehicles or a leased vehicle risk being 
legally liable. Please refer to TRN-03 for regulations on field 
trip transportation. 


Page 11:
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-23 
Page 11 of 36 
 
 If your trip is less than 100 driving miles in distance, please 
ensure ALL students have valid medical insurance that 
covers them while on this program. Record details of 
insurance on the Medical Information form. 
ONE WEEK PRIOR TO TRIP 
 Verify all arrangements, including transportation and 
reception at the site. 
 Prepare name tags for younger students. 
 Provisions must be made in advance for any student not 
attending the trip and staying at school. If applicable, 
provide alternative arrangements and/or comparable 
activities for students not attending the trip or unable to 
participate in a portion of your trip. 
 If a student’s family elects for their child not to attend a field 
trip for any reason, the child may not be penalized through 
their grade or otherwise. 
 Remind students and chaperones of safety and behavior 
expectations.  
 Notify/consult with the principal/head of school if trip plans 
have changed from the original field trip request. Prepare 
and leave a field trip package for the principal/head of 
school that includes CAO-23 checklist, Day Field Trip 
Request form, and permission slip copies. 
DURING THE FIELD TRIP 
 Take attendance and leave the current list of students 
attending the trip with the principal/head of school.  
 Record specific bus number and driver’s name and leave 
information with the principal/head of school, all 


Page 12:

Page 12 of 36 
 
chaperones, and, if age appropriate, students. 
 Chaperones must supervise all assigned students. Conduct 
head counts and buddy checks before embarking on your 
trip, throughout your trip, and before departing the field trip 
site for home. 
 Review standards for safety and behavior with students. 
 Chaperones must carry the trip binder at all times on the 
trip which includes the following: permission slips (original, 
signed permission slips must be carried by the lead 
chaperone), Emergency Action Plan, Day Field Trip Request 
form, and any accompanying itinerary details for this 
particular trip. 
 All students must have the contact information of 
chaperones and other necessary emergency and contact 
information.  
 Do not leave students alone. Students should be 
accompanied by chaperones unless part of a scheduled 
activity of which parents have been informed and have 
approved in writing in advance, and that is age appropriate. 
However, if unaccompanied as part of a scheduled and 
structured activity, students should be in at least pairs AND 
always know how to reach an adult chaperone. 
 Review with everyone where they are to go if separated 
from the group. 
 Program leaders and chaperones have the responsibility to 
modify the program to ensure the ongoing safety of 
travelers. Consult with principal/head of school and 
Department of Safety Services if this becomes necessary.
