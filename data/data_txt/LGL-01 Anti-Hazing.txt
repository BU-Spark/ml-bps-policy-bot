HAZING LAW 
Massachusetts law makes it a crime to engage in hazing 
activities. Hazing means any conduct or method of initiation into 
any student organization, whether on public or private property, 
which willfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental 
health of any student or other person. A copy of the 
Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education’s advisory 
is attached hereto as Attachment 1. 
Middle school principals, heads of school, and principals of K-8 
schools should treat hazing as a violation of Section 7.2.5 of the 
Code of Conduct with attendant sanctions. They are required by 
state law to take the following steps: 
1. Distribute a copy of the amended law [Attachment 1] to 
each school-based student organization on or before 
September 15. 
2. Obtain from each such student organization a statement, 
signed by a designated officer of the organization, 
indicating that: 
a. the organization has received a copy of the law. 
b. each of its members, plebes, pledges, or applicants 
has received a copy of the law. 
c. the organization understands and agrees to comply 
with the law.

The designated officer's signature should be 
witnessed by an adult (i.e., faculty advisor), who 
should also sign the statement. These statements 
should be retained in the main office. A sample 
acknowledgment is attached to this memorandum 
as Attachment 2 for your convenience. 
3. Distribute a copy of the law to all students in grades 7 
through 12 at least annually. Middle school principals, 
heads of school, and principals of K-8 schools must certify 
that the school complies with the anti-hazing law to the 
Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary 
Education on or before October 1, by logging into the 
anti-hazing application accessible via MassEdu Gateway.  
4. The law also requires anyone who knows that another 
person is the victim of hazing to report such an incident 
to an appropriate law enforcement official as soon as 
possible and provides criminal penalties for failure to do 
so.

REMINDER ABOUT MASSACHUSETTS LAW PROHIBITING THE 
PRACTICE OF HAZING 
School Year 2023-2024 Anti-Hazing Data Collection 
 
The anti-hazing law, which was enacted in 1985, applies only to 
secondary schools in Massachusetts. Please note that a middle 
school that has been designated as a secondary school by the 
school committee must comply with the anti-hazing law and 
regulations. 
Under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 269, Sections 17–
19 and 603 CMR 33.00, all secondary schools, both public and 
private, must: 
• Adopt anti-hazing policies as part of their disciplinary 
policies. 
• Distribute copies of the anti-hazing law to all students 
enrolled full-time; to all student groups, teams, and 
organizations that are part of or are recognized by the 
school or are permitted by the school to use its name and 
facilities; and to all known unaffiliated student groups, 
teams, or organizations. 
Every year, secondary school principals/heads of school must: 
• Certify that you have read and understood the Anti-Hazing 
Policy and that the school has complied with the law by 
logging into the new Anti-Hazing application accessible via 


Page 5:
Superintendent’s Circular LGL-01 
Page 5 of 11 
 
MassEdu Gateway at https://gateway.edu.state.ma.us/ 
• High school principals/heads of school (or a designee) who 
need access should be assigned their school’s Anti-Hazing 
user role by their district’s directory administrator. If you 
have questions about this, contact your directory 
administrator. 
• If your school does not have a directory administrator, or if 
you need help with your user ID and password, please 
contact Nermina Peric at nperic@doe.ma.us. 
• The schools must certify with the department on or before 
October 1. By November 1, the department must notify the 
Attorney General of any school that has not filed a report. 
• Collect a signed acknowledgement from a contact person 
for each student organization regarding distribution of 
information and agreement to comply with the law. The 
schools are not required to submit the Student Group Anti-
Hazing Form but should keep the form for their records. 
The guidance in this memorandum is intended to ensure that all 
public and private secondary schools meet their obligations 
under this important law and that students know the rules, 
expectations, and consequences regarding hazing. If you need 
additional information about the anti-hazing law and secondary 
schools' responsibilities, please contact Nermina Peric at 781-338-
3708.
