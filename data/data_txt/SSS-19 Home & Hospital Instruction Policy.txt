HOME AND HOSPITAL INSTRUCTION SERVICES 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version 
            
 
POLICY 
The intent of Boston Public Schools (BPS) Home and Hospital 
Instruction is to provide a student receiving a publicly funded 
education with the opportunity to make educational progress 
even when a physician determines that the student is medically 
unable to attend school. In compliance with Massachusetts 
regulation 603 CMR 28.03(3), BPS Home and Hospital Instruction 
collaborates with schools, parents, agencies, and hospitals to 
ensure alignment of educational goals and curriculum for 
accurate service delivery to provide, at a minimum, the 
instruction necessary to enable the student to maintain progress 
in their courses of study and minimize the educational loss that 
might occur during the period when the student is confined at 
home or in a hospital. Services are provided with sufficient 
frequency to allow the student to continue their educational 
program, as long as such services do not interfere with the 
medical needs of the student.

INTENT OF MASSACHUSETTS REGULATIONS ON EDUCATIONAL 
SERVICES IN THE HOME OR HOSPITAL 
Home and Hospital Instruction is not to be confused with Special 
Education services, “unless the student has been determined 
eligible for such services, and the services include services on the 
student’s IEP.” Home and Hospital Instruction is a special type of 
service provided under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
and state law for the purpose of ensuring that medically involved 
students receiving a publicly funded education have equal access 
to education as do their counterparts. Publicly funded education 
includes Boston Public Schools, charter schools, Boston resident 
students who are enrolled at out of district schools, including 
METCO and private placements, and students on private tuition 
(see Attachment B). Students who are on private tuition are 
eligible only if they have an Individualized Education Program 
(IEP) or fall under the special education umbrella. 
The eligibility guidelines of Home and Hospital Instruction are: 
● A physician determines that a student is physically unable 
to attend school. 
● A student has been or will be out of school for more than 14 
consecutive days or can be anticipated to accumulate more 
than 14 absences in a school year at home or in a hospital 
(i.e., sickle cell disease, cancer treatment, etc.).  
● When it is deemed by the student’s attending physician or 
pediatrician that they will be confined to a home or hospital 
setting for more than 60 (sixty) days, the student will then 
be evaluated by the Special Education Department under 
state guideline/regulation 603 CMR 28.04(4). When it is 


Page 3:
Superintendent’s Circular SSS-19 
Page 3 of 13 
 
 
 
known that a student will be out for more than 60 (sixty) 
days, it is recommended that the physician complete the 60 
Day Physician Statement. 
● A student is marked Constructively Present (CP) for the 
period during which the student receives home/hospital-
based services and receives a passing grade for all work that 
has been satisfactorily completed. No home/hospital-based 
instruction will be provided over the summer break unless 
designated in an IEP and the child is unable to attend 
Extended School Year. 
IMPLEMENTATION OF HOME AND HOSPITAL INSTRUCTION 
Role of the parent: 
● Provide consent for the exchange of information between 
the student's physician and the district to ensure an open 
line of communication between service providers.  
● Maintain communication with the school to ensure that 
grading is occurring according to classroom guidelines. 
● Inform school of the student’s medical needs that will 
require home and hospital instruction. 
● Provide the school nurse with all the medical information to 
ensure that when the student is in school, the medications, 
procedures, and protocols are in place to ensure medical 
safety and optimal learning. This includes completing, along 
with the physician of record, the Individual Collaborative 
Health Plan (ICHP) form if the physician indicates that the 
student’s health during this period will affect the provision 
of full educational services and this form has not previously 


Page 4:
Superintendent’s Circular SSS-19 
Page 4 of 13 
 
 
 
been completed. 
● Ensure that the student’s physician of record completes the 
Home and Hospital Physician Statement form and the ICHP. 
● Participate in the action plan for their child based on the 
ICHP and the Physician Statement. 
● Provide an appropriate learning environment at home. 
● Ensure that someone over the age of 18 is at home when the 
tutoring occurs (or arranges a neutral meeting place such as 
a library), notify the central office if the tutor does not keep 
the appointment, and sign the instructor’s sheet after each 
session. 
Role of the physician: 
● Submits a completed Physician Statement (see Attachment 
A) verifying the medical or psychological illness to the 
school’s nurse for verification. When it is known that a 
student will be out for more than 60 days, it is 
recommended that the physician complete the 60 Day 
Physician Statement. 
The Physician Statement should include the date the 
student will be confined, medical diagnosis, expected return 
date, and medical information that may prevent the student 
from accessing the provision of a full education.   
● If the physician identifies on the Physician Statement that 
the student’s health during this period will affect the 
provision of full educational services, the physician needs to 
complete the ICHP in conjunction with the parent. 
● The physician is expected to remain aware of the time frame

the child is out of school. 
● Participate in a re-entry plan to ensure the child can return 
to the school environment without impediments. 
ROLE OF THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR: 
● Identifies a person to be the school contact (i.e., guidance 
counselor, student support staff, nurse, or administrator) 
who will serve as a liaison for students who are home and 
hospital bound. 
● Submit the designated point of contact to the Home and 
Hospital Instruction Program within the Department of 
Opportunity Youth (OY). 
● If needed, refer a school-based teacher to Home and 
Hospital Instruction to serve as the home tutor.  
● Ensure appropriate school-level communications to prompt 
a timely N1 team meeting with special education for 
students who will be out for more than 60 days. 
● Oversee the coordination of key school staff to ensure 
students in Home and Hospital Instruction have school-
based support in the areas of academics, curriculum, 
attendance, and testing as appropriate and necessary.  
Role of the school nurse: 
● The school nurse reviews and submits the completed 
Physician’s Statement form and non-BPS student form to 
Home and Hospital Instruction (617-635-6633) for 
coordination of services. 
● Communicate with the Home and Hospital Instruction team

as needed to ensure students have appropriate access to 
services and tutoring. 
● Coordinate with the physician or medical provider as 
needed to confirm, verify, or request updates to information 
in Physician Statement. 
● Collaborate with the school-based and Special Education 
team to ensure appropriate support of the student’s 
academic goals while in Home and Hospital Instruction. 
● Request a medical update from the physician after 2 
months if the student still needs home tutoring. 
● When it is known that a student will be out for more than 60 
days, it is recommended that the school nurse coordinate 
with the family and/or medical provider to ensure that the 
physician completes the 60 Day Physician Statement. 
Role of the teacher: 
● Ensure that the student follows the same classroom syllabus 
and rubric as the non-medically involved students. 
● Modify home and hospital assignments as needed so the 
student can continue to make academic progress. 
● Correct the work and assign appropriate grades to the 
student. 
● Notify parents of the student’s progress. 
Role of the identified school-based contact to Home and 
Hospital Instruction: 
● Determine if online curriculum is appropriate and posts 
online.

● Collect materials/assignments from the student’s teachers 
for the home and hospital instructors. 
● If students are hospitalized, the school contact provides 
materials/assignments to parents.  Work can also be faxed 
or emailed to the hospital instructors. 
● If a student is homebound, the school contact provides 
materials/assignments to the home instructors. 
● Communicate frequently with the Home & Hospital 
Instruction Program, home-based instructors, students, and 
parents to assure continuity of services and that student 
needs are being met. 
● Receive completed work from the home or hospital 
instructors and deliver the work to the student’s teachers. 
● Ensure students are not being marked absent but as 
Constructively Present (CP). Students’ attendance should

not report’ (DNR) and automatic withdrawal from school. 
● Ensure grades are entered and report cards are generated. 
● Sign off on home instructor timesheet once monthly. 
● Retain copy of scholastic and attendance records. 
● Work with the Office of Special Education to assure qualified 
students are evaluated for an IEP or 504 plan.
