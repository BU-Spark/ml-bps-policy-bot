Version 01 
 
RESPONSE TO CARDIAC ARREST IN SCHOOLS AND 
SCHOOL PROPERTY: AUTOMATIC EXTERNAL 
DEFIBRILLATOR (AED) USE AND ACCESS POLICY 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded by a 
subsequent version 
POLICY STATEMENT 
The Boston Public Schools recognizes that an Emergency 
Medical Response Plan is multifaceted and is designed to 
respond to life-threatening medical emergencies in the first 
minutes before emergency medical services arrive. The elements 
of the policy include: effective communication throughout the 
individual school and the district, a coordinated and practiced 
response plan, risk reduction, training and equipment for first aid 
and CPR, and a lay rescuer AED program. 
This policy addresses the Cardiac Arrest Plan and focuses on CPR 
and AED use. It interfaces with Superintendent’s Circulars  FSE-
05 Medical Emergencies; FSE-01 School Safety and Contingency 
Plans; and SHS-11 Life-Threatening Allergies. It is also coordinated 
with the City of Boston Public Access Defibrillator Program 
(PAD). Detailed procedures and protocols, including a 
Memorandum of Agreement between BPS and Boston EMS, are 
available through Facilities Management.

BACKGROUND 
Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) presents a potential life-threatening 
situation to students, staff, and visitors, and quick response 
actions and interventions like cardio-pulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR) and proper use of an automatic external defibrillator (AED) 
within the first two (2) minutes significantly increases the chance 
of SCA survival.  
PROTOCOL FOR DISTRICTWIDE RESPONSIBILITIES 
The City of Boston’s Public Access Defibrillator Program (PAD) 
requires that a systemwide policy be established that interfaces 
with the district's School Safety and Contingency Plans. These 
plans are submitted each year.  
In BPS, the AED/CPR policy is directed by an AED/CPR 
Committee. This systemwide AED Committee includes but is not 
limited to representation from Health Services, Facilities 
Management (Environmental and Safety), BPS Operations, and 
City of Boston’s Emergency Management Services (BEMS). The 
responsibility of this team is to oversee the AED and CPR 
program, including quality assurance, data review of critical 
incidents, equipment maintenance, inventory management, 
coordinated and practiced response exercises, and lay CPR and 
AED training.  
• All school buildings have been provided with AEDs.  All BPS 
school buildings with an AED will need to register their 
individual plans along with their annual safety contingency 
plans. Staff who have been trained in CPR will be added to 


Page 3:

Page 3 of 22 
 
the school safety contingency plan and reviewed/updated 
annually. 
• AEDs have been provided to the BPS Athletics Program for 
selected coaches to have in their possession during any 
athletic event or practice. The BPS Athletic Program shall 
meet the same requirements and intent of the AED/CPR 
program for school buildings, including providing an 
inventory of the AEDs and their designated coaches (those 
coaches who are responsible for the AED during their sport’s 
season). 
PROTOCOL FOR INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL RESPONSIBILITIES 
Principal/Head of School: 
• Ensures that there is an appropriately trained AED/CPR 
coordinator at their school.* 
• Ensures that there is the required number of CPR trained 
personnel in the school.

BOSTON PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
PUBLIC ACCESS DEFIBRILLATION PROGRAM AND  
CPR GUIDELINES 
 
PURPOSE:  The purpose of the Boston Public Schools Public 
Access Defibrillation (PAD) Program guidelines is to assist 
employees of the Boston Public Schools who are trained and 
willing to do CPR, including use of an Automatic External 
Defibrillator (AED) in the event such use is necessary.  These 
guidelines do not create an obligation to do CPR and use the 
AEDs, nor to create any expectation that either an AED or trained 
employee will be present at every event.  The guidelines should 
make clear that by increasing the availability of AEDs and 
increasing the number of persons trained to use them, that both 
the school and larger community may be aided.  Evidence shows 
that time is a significant factor in victim survival rate, and on-site 
responders are more likely to arrive faster than EMS to begin aid 
to incidents of “sudden death”.  By equipping and training 
voluntary employees in the use of AEDs, we will increase the 
potential to save lives through AED intervention. 
DEFINITION:  The condition “sudden death” occurs when the 
electrical impulses of the human heart malfunction, causing a 
disturbance in the heart’s electrical rhythm called “ventricular 
fibrillation (VF)”.  This erratic and ineffective electrical heart 
rhythm causes complete cessation of the heart’s normal function 
of pumping oxygenated blood, resulting in “sudden death”.  The 
most effective treatment for this condition is the administration 
of an electrical current to the heart by a defibrillator, within the 


Page 12:
Superintendent’s Circular SHS-22 
Page 12 of 22 
 
shortest time possible of VF onset.  Each minute of delay in 
defibrillator use decreases the survival rate by 10%. 
PROGRAM PROCEDURES:  The Boston Public Schools anticipates 
that where reasonably possible, employees who have been 
trained and who are present when an incident occurs will react 
by activating the EMS system (calling 9-1-1 or 9-9-1-1), begin CPR, 
and utilize the AED available to them according to the guidelines 
of the American Heart Association. 
PROGRAM OVERSIGHT: The City of Boston’s Public Access 
Defibrillator Program (PAD) requires that a systemwide policy be 
established.  This system-wide AED committee includes but is 
not limited to representation from Health Services (Health 
Services), Facilities Management (Environmental and Safety), BPS 
Operations, and City of Boston’s Emergency Management 
Services (BEMS). This committee meets monthly and guides the 
program implementation and quality assurance. 
The EMS medical director agrees to act as the medical director 
for the BPS PAD Program, ensuring its consistency with the 
Community AED Public Access program and reviewing each 
deployment of the AED with the BPS team.   
The Boston Public Schools physician / medical director is 
responsible for: writing prescriptions for purchase of AEDs; 
reviewing and approving guidelines for emergency procedures 
related to the use of AEDs; reviewing all AED deployments; and 
coordination with the local EMS medical director for consistency 
of operation. 
The BPS assistant director of Health Services (nursing director) 
will be the overall AED coordinator of the program, chairing the 


Page 13:
Superintendent’s Circular SHS-22 
Page 13 of 22 
 
CPR/AED committee. This systemwide AED committee includes 
but is not limited to representation from Health Services (Health 
Services), Facilities Management (Environmental and Safety), BPS 
Operations, and City of Boston’s Emergency Management 
Services (BEMS). The responsibility of this team is to oversee the 
AED and CPR program, including quality assurance, data review 
of critical incidents, equipment maintenance and inventory 
management, coordinated procurement of funding, practiced 
response exercises, and lay CPR and AED training. 
PRE-PROGRAM EVALUATION AND AED SELECTION 
Only US FDA approved AEDs will be provided for this program.  
The program manager and Facilities Management Department 
will maintain the specification/technical information sheet for 
each approved AED on file assigned and/or donated to the PAD 
program. 
All BPS schools have at least one AED. 
AEDs have been provided to the BPS Athletics Program for 
selected coaches to have in their possession during any athletic 
event or practice. The BPS Athletics Program shall meet the 
same requirements and intent of the AED program for school 
buildings.

Superintendent’s Circular SHS-22 
Page 14 of 22 
 
TRAINING  
All volunteer employees and coaches will participate in a 
recognized CPR/AED initial training course which will include the 
following content: 
• Proper use, maintenance, and periodic inspection of AED. 
• Assessment of an unconscious person to determine if a 
cardiac arrest has occurred and the appropriateness of 
applying the AED. 
• Defibrillator safety precaution to enable the user to 
administer a shock without jeopardizing the safety of the 
victim, the user, or other persons on the scene. 
• Rapid accurate assessment of the victim’s post-shock status 
to determine if further activation of AED is necessary. 
• The role of the initial rescuer in the coordination of care for 
the cardiac arrest victim on arrival of EMS personnel. 
• Scenario based practice consistent with common scenarios 
that rescuers may face.   
• Routine AED maintenance, troubleshooting options, and 
special situations that initial rescuers may encounter. 
Employees will only be held to the standards of “Good Samaritan” 
status and shall only be expected to use an AED if they have 
successfully completed the CPR/AED training and feel confident 
using the device.

Superintendent’s Circular SHS-22 
Page 15 of 22 
 
SKILLS REVIEW AND PROFICIENCY DEMONSTRATION 
The AED team candidate will need to demonstrate proficiency in 
adult CPR and the following: 
• Safe and effective use of the AED training device that 
conforms to the unit assigned to that location or building. 
• Perform a single or multi-shock practical exam conducted 
by a qualified AHA or ARC instructor. 
• Demonstrate common trouble-shooting techniques used 
with the AED. 
• All AED team members will participate in a CPR/AED skills 
proficiency review annually.  The PAD program manager will 
maintain the proper training and review documentation. 
LOCATION OF AEDS 
All BPS school buildings with an AED must register their plan 
with BPS Safety Services. All school buildings have been provided 
with AEDs. If additional AEDs are to be purchased, it must be 
done through BPS HS or with the approval of BPS HS. AED will be 
numbered for internal identification and inventory. These records 
shall be kept and maintained under BPS HS.  
All AEDs shall be located immediately outside the main 
administrative office unless a written exemption with stated 
reasons for another location is provided. All AEDs are placed in an 
alarmed metal cabinet with an identifying AED location sign 
above it. Other signs identifying AED location will be placed in 
common areas throughout the school building. For additional 
signage or if there are any missing or broken signs, please 


Page 16:
Superintendent’s Circular SHS-22 
Page 16 of 22 
 
contact Facilities Management – Environmental Section at 617-
635-8300.  
AEDs are located outside the main administrative office because 
it is a well-identified location with continued access during 
school occupancy and operating hours. In cases of BPS school 
buildings sharing the building complex with another BPS school 
program or DYFS Community School or Center, if possible, a 
location may be chosen that would allow access to both 
programs’ operating hours.  All AEDs shall be kept in the alarmed 
metal cabinet, with the exception of AEDs provided specifically 
for BPS Athletics Department. 
MAINTENANCE AND TESTING 
Maintenance and testing will be conducted according to the 
requirements of the FDA and the AED manufacturer.  
Documentation of maintenance and testing will be maintained in 
the PAD program manager’s office (nursing coordinator) for a 
period of two years.  Documentation will record the date of 
testing and the signature of the person performing the testing.  If 
a problem with the AED is identified, the AED coordinator must 
be notified immediately. 
Responsibility for overall maintenance check assignments in 
each location will be with the BPS AED/CPR coordinator in 
coordination with a designated person in each building.  A 
person in each building will be responsible for: 
• Daily visual checks and documentation during the actual 
contracted school year. (Summer locations and checks will 


Page 17:
Superintendent’s Circular SHS-22 
Page 17 of 22 
 
be determined by summer program use of the buildings, 
and Boston EMS will be notified of the Summer Plan.) 
• Prompt notification of PAD program manager for any 
equipment or supply needs. The designated building 
coordinator will be responsible for scheduling AED training 
courses in their building.  Authorized AHA instructors will 
assist with training on AED use. 
USE OF THE AED 
General 
• Scene safety is vital. Rescuers are volunteers and are not 
expected to place themselves at risk to provide aid to 
others.  To assess for scene safety: 
o Verify that the victim is not in contact with any live 
electrical connections. 
o Remove the victim from any exposure to water to a dry 
surface. 
o Refrain from use of any portable radios near the victim 
while AED is analyzing. 
• During school hours, the building program coordinator will 
be notified of any event occurring that may require the use 
of an AED. 
• During afterschool hours, a trained athletic coach or their 
designee may move the AED from its current location to 
support Athletic Department activities.  A visible notice 
must be clearly stating the location of the AED as well as the 
location of the nearest AED, if another one exists. 


Page 18:
Superintendent’s Circular SHS-22 
Page 18 of 22 
 
• Contracted and community activities are not guaranteed 
access to the AED or a trained AED operator as part of 
standard school facility rental contracts. 
Actual Use of AED in a Cardiac Event 
• Determine unresponsiveness of the victim and activate the 
Emergency Response Plan (Call 9-1-1). 
o If a victim is unresponsive, call 9-1-1 (or 9-9-1-1) and get 
AED. 
o Assess victim (airway, breathing circulation). 
o Initiate CPR, if required, while AED is brought to the 
victim's side. 
o Designate a person to wait for a facility entry to direct 
EMS to location. 
o Notify nursing coordinator of use to assign backup AED 
unit, if available 
• Upon arrival of AED, place AED next to the head of the 
victim, close to the AED operator. 
• Prepare to use the AED: 
o Turn power ON. 
o Bare and prepare chest for AED use. 
o Attach AED to victim (picture guides on each pad for 
proper placement location). 
o Stop CPR while the AED device analyzes the heart 
rhythm. 


Page 19:
Superintendent’s Circular SHS-22 
Page 19 of 22 
 
o Follow the machine prompts for further action.  If a 
shock is indicated, be sure all rescuers are “clear” 
before shock is administered. 
• Upon arrival, EMS shall take charge of the victim. 
o Provide victim information (name, age, known medical 
history, time of incident). 
o Provide information as to current condition and 
number of shocks delivered. 
o Defibrillator pads and electrodes shall remain in place 
on the victim.  EMS will utilize BPS AED through 
transport of victims to hospital to maintain continuity 
of event recording. 
AFTER USE OF AED 
• First responders will notify the program coordinator by 
phone of the incident, complete an incident report, and fax 
to the program coordinator. 
• A Critical Incident debriefing session will be held or 
scheduled within 24 hours for initial responders.  (Boston 
EMS may not be immediately available.) 
• The health services director and program coordinator will be 
notified of AED use and: 
o Complete follow-up report for medical directors. 
o Arrange for a quality improvement meeting of AED 
responders. 
o The AED will be checked and put back in readiness 
state. 


Page 20:
