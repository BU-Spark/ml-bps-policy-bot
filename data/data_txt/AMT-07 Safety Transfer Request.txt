Circular 
NUMBER: 
AMT-07 
Version 01 
 
 
SAFETY TRANSFER REQUEST PROCEDURES 
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded by a 
subsequent version. 
From time to time, it becomes necessary to make a change in a 
student’s school assignment. One reason for such an assignment 
change may be motivated by the need to ensure a safe and 
secure learning environment for that student.  For this reason, a 
safety transfer process has been established.   
CRITERIA 
1. All students who are victims or intended victims of a serious 
physical, emotional, and/or electronically transmitted assault 
or who are victims of a violent criminal offense, as determined 
by state law, while in or on school grounds, or out of school 
that impacts school climate, shall be eligible for a safety 
transfer.  All such request forms must have attached BPS 
Incident Reports and/or BPD Reports to document the 
incident. The transfer should be processed by the building 
administrator within ten (10) school days of the receipt of the 
Safety Transfer Request Form.                                    
Students who are perpetrators are subject to the Code of 
Conduct and not eligible for a safety transfer.   
2. Students attending a school designated as “unsafe or 
persistently dangerous” in accordance with Massachusetts 


Page 2:
Superintendent’s Circular AMT-07 
Page 2 of 12 
 
 
Department of Education criteria, upon receipt of a parent 
request, shall be transferred to a safe school in compliance 
with the Every Student Succeeds Act (“ESSA”).  The purpose of 
the ESSA is to provide all children a significant opportunity to 
receive a fair, equitable, and high-quality education, and to 
close educational achievement gaps." 
3. Students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) are 
subject to this transfer procedure provided the building 
administrator has consulted with the OSESS coordinator.  
Resource Room students shall be dealt with in the same 
manner as regular education students.  Students with IEPs 
providing a specialized program and/or requiring a restrictive 
setting shall be reassigned after consultation between the 
coordinator and OSESS assistant program director (APD).  
4. Court orders requiring a transfer of a student shall be honored 
and coded as a safety transfer.  A copy of the court order 
should be forwarded to the operational leader as a part of the 
documentation packet in all cases. 
5. In all cases, student assignments shall be made by Welcome 
Services.  Requests for specific school assignments will not be 
honored, but rather they shall be based on criteria established 
by Welcome Services, as well as on the need to ensure a safe 
learning environment and on the needs of the student. 
PROCEDURES  
The following procedures must be followed in all safety transfer 
cases: 
1. All safety transfer requests must be initiated by the 
parent/guardian/caregiver of the impacted student. 


Page 3:
Superintendent’s Circular AMT-07 
Page 3 of 12 
 
 
2. The parent/guardian/caregiver should schedule a meeting 
with the head of school/principal/program director of the 
school to which the student is assigned in order to discuss the 
circumstances surrounding the need for a safety transfer. 
3. The parent/guardian/caregiver must complete and sign the 
“Safety Transfer Request Form” (attached).  All requests for 
safety transfers must be referred to the head of 
school/principal/program director for review and 
recommendation. 
4. The head of school/principal/program director shall conduct a 
thorough investigation in response to the 
parent/guardian/caregiver’s request and must gather all 
pertinent information and documentation.  If the student has 
an IEP, the building administrator shall consult with the 
coordinator.  The building administrator will provide a rationale 
for support or rejection of the transfer request on the reverse 
side of the Safety Transfer Form.  The form must be signed by 
the principal/head of school. Please note: this responsibility 
may not be delegated.  If the problem is gang-related, the 
names of the gangs involved should be noted.  If the incident 
has occurred off school grounds, a copy of the Boston Police 
Department report should be obtained; if the incident 
occurred on school grounds, a copy of the Boston Public 
School Incident Report should be attached to the 
documentation packet. 
 
5. If the head of school/principal supports the safety transfer 
request, they must indicate and sign the Safety Transfer Form. 
The completed transfer packet should be sent to the 
operational leader for approval and processing. 


Page 4:
Superintendent’s Circular AMT-07 
Page 4 of 12 
 
 
The complete safety transfer packet must include: 
a. Completed and signed English version as well as a copy of 
the parent’s safety transfer request form, including the 
building administrator’s rationale for support or rejection 
of request on page 2.  If the language of the home is other 
than English, the parent/guardian/caregiver should 
complete the appropriate language form which should 
be attached to the English version in the packet. 
b. All pertinent supporting documentation (i.e., court orders, 
restraining orders, police reports, reports of investigation 
by school staff or safety services, etc.) If the student has 
been the victim of an assault. 
c. If attending an “unsafe or persistently dangerous school,” 
documentation supporting the school designation as 
such. 
6. If the building administrator does not support the safety 
transfer, a rationale indicating specific reasons for rejecting the 
transfer, including appropriate documentation, must be 
forwarded with the safety transfer packet to the operational 
leader.  
7. The packet must be submitted as soon as possible to the 
operational leader for review of completeness and 
appropriateness. The operational leader is authorized to 
approve or reject the request. 
8. Before forwarding a copy of the approved packet to Welcome 
Services, the operational leader shall consult with the 
Department of Safety Services to discuss potential restrictions 
to school assignments (e.g., gang-related issues, “persistently 
dangerous” schools, etc.). If the student is assigned to a 


Page 5:
Superintendent’s Circular AMT-07 
Page 5 of 12 
 
 
substantially separate class, the operational leader shall 
consult with the OSE coordinator and the OSE assistant 
director. 
9. The operational leader will forward the complete safety 
transfer packet of the approved safety transfer request to 
Welcome Services for processing an assignment.  If safety 
issues were raised in discussions with Safety Services (c.f.  item 
8 above), the operational leader shall call these issues to the 
attention of Welcome Services.  Requests which are not 
approved will be returned to the citing the reasons for 
rejection.  If the student requires a substantially separate 
assignment, Welcome Services and appropriate APD shall 
consult.  
10. Welcome Services shall assign the student to the new school 
and notify the receiving and sending schools and the 
appropriate operational leader by email.  The head of 
school/principal/program director of the sending school shall 
notify the parent/guardian/caretaker of the student’s new 
school assignment.  If the safety transfer is not approved, the 
“sending” building administrator shall notify the parent that 
the request has been rejected. 
11. If the transfer is approved, the operational leader shall send a 
copy of the Transfer Form with copies of all attached 
documentation to the new school principal/head of school.  If 
the new building administrator has any further questions, the 
sending school building administrator shall respond to those 
questions. The sending school shall forward a copy of the 
student record to the new school. 
12. Any appeal of a decision at the school level may be made to 
the District Safety Transfer Appeal Committee.  An appeal 


Page 6:
Superintendent’s Circular AMT-07 
Page 6 of 12 
 
 
must be made by the parent/guardian/caregiver, in writing, 
within ten (10) days of the receipt of the decision.  An appeal 
can either be submitted in writing and mailed to the attention 
of the Superintendent’s Office, Attn: Ombudsperson, Bruce C. 
Bolling Municipal Building, 2300 Washington Street, Roxbury 
MA 02119 or electronically by submitting the Safety Transfer 
Appeal Form. 
Please Note: 
1. During the summer months, no safety transfers will be 
processed.  Any family seeking a change in school assignment 
due to safety concerns must follow the voluntary transfer 
process by visiting a BPS Welcome Center.  
2. The family has the right to refuse the new school assignment.  
If so, the parent/guardian/caretaker should contact the 
principal/head of school and operational leader that they are 
rescinding the safety transfer request. In this case, the student 
will be returned to their original school and will not be 
permitted to submit an additional safety transfer request 
regarding the incident that initiated the original safety transfer 
request.
