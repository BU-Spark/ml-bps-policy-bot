Version 01 
 
 
 
BPS BALANCED ASSESSMENT SYSTEM  
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
Student assessment is an effective tool to support success inside 
and outside of the classroom. Assessment takes many forms, and 
it is the responsibility of all in the Boston Public Schools to use 
the data that emerges from assessments to ensure that every 
student receives what they need every day. 
PURPOSE 
The Boston Public Schools assessment system supports the 
district's strategic goals of eliminating opportunity gaps and 
accelerating learning. The assessment system: 
● provides teachers, administrators, students, parents, 
the district, and the community with ongoing 
information regarding student progress in relation to 
state frameworks. 
● ensures all our students are prepared for college, 
career, and life. 
A balanced assessment system includes formative and 
summative assessments that provide information on the 
classroom, school, and district levels and is responsive to needs at 
each of these levels.

1. At the classroom level, the assessment system provides 
teachers with data on students’ strengths and needs so that 
teachers may develop lessons that respond to individual 
differences.  
2. At the school level, the assessment system provides school 
leaders and instructional leadership teams with data to help 
them measure school success based on school and district 
goals:  
a. Assess the effectiveness of curriculum, instruction, and 
professional development programs. 
b. Work with teachers to develop strategies that attend 
to priority areas.  
3. At the district level, the assessment system provides district 
leaders with information that allows them to determine if 
the system, individual schools, and central departments are 
making progress regarding the district’s long-term teaching 
and learning goals. Information is needed to assess the 
effectiveness of specific initiatives being implemented to 
achieve those goals, to implement effective practices, and to 
eliminate practices that are unsuccessful. Quality 
information allows comparisons across programs, schools, 
and classrooms to be data-driven and equitable. 
ASSESSMENT EXPECTATIONS  
For SY24-25, district assessment expectations will maintain its 
instructional focus on Equitable Literacy across all content areas 
to strengthen equitable Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS), 
laying a strong Tier 1 infrastructure to become a fully inclusive 
district and expand access to bilingual/native language

instruction. As BPS more consistently implements effective 
equitable literacy practices, the data provided by assessments 
will inform educators to meet the learning needs of all students. 
These expectations are a minimum for schools; school 
communities are encouraged to craft the assessment strategy 
that supports their own work towards grade-level, standards-
aligned, culturally responsive instruction.  
The following tables outline the formative and summative 
assessments in use in Boston Public Schools during SY24-25, 
including the purpose, grade level, participation expectation and 
frequency.
