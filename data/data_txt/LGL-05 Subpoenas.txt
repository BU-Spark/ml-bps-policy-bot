Circular 
NUMBER: 
LGL-05 
Version 01 
 
SUBPOENAS 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or suspended 
by a subsequent version.. 
SUBPOENA: When receiving a subpoena for student records, 
personnel records, medical records, or any other document, a 
copy of the subpoena must be emailed or delivered 
immediately to the Office of Legal Advisor for review. 
Subsequent to that, please forward all responsive records with 
the original subpoena to the Office of Legal Advisor. Such a 
subpoena should be emailed or delivered, even if it is addressed 
to an individual, rather than the “keeper of the records.” Witness 
subpoenas (i.e., a subpoena that seeks testimony rather than 
documents) should also be emailed or delivered to the Office of 
Legal Advisor for appropriate consultation. 
 If sending by email, please email legal@bostonpublicschools.org.
