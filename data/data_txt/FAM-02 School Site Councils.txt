Superintendent’s 
Circular 
NUMBER: 
FAM-02 
Version 01 
 
 
   SCHOOL SITE COUNCILS  
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
 
Engaging families and students as equal partners has been 
identified as a core strategy for improving student performance 
in the Boston School Committee goals and the BPS Engagement 
Policy. Family and student engagement is also a significant 
component of the Massachusetts School-Level Administrator 
Rubric.  
This circular has been developed to help principals/heads of 
school effectively implement School Site Councils (SSC) as a 
foundational structure for engaging parents and students in 
school-based decision-making and school improvement. The 
Office of Family and Community Advancement (OFCA) 
collaborates with the Boston Teachers Union (BTU) to provide 
oversight and support for SSCs.  
For the purposes of this circular, the term “parent” includes a 
legal guardian or other person standing in loco parentis (such as 
a grandparent or stepparent with whom the child lives, or a 
person who is legally responsible for the child's welfare). Sect. 
9101(31) ESEA.

ROLE AND PURPOSE 
The role of the School Site Council is to engage parents and 
teachers to serve with the principal/head of school as the central 
decision-making body of the school. SSCs are required by the 
Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993 and by the 
collective bargaining agreement between the Boston Teachers 
Union (BTU) and the Boston School Committee.  
Under the school-based management/shared decision-making 
model described in the collective bargaining agreement 
between BPS and the BTU, the role of the SSC is to:  
● Review and approve the Quality School Plan within 
guidelines established by the superintendent.  
● Review and approve the recommendations of the 
Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) that have been 
endorsed by the principal/head of school and that will have 
a major effect on the school community. 
● Review and comment on the entire school budget, 
including the general funds and external funds budgets, in a 
timely fashion.  
● Approve the budget for discretionary school materials, 
supplies, textbooks, and equipment, including the use of 
school improvement award funds. 
● Review and approve recommendations from any other 
committee or group that is established to recommend 
changes that will have a major effect on the school 
community. 
● Develop and approve plans for increasing parent 
engagement in the school. 


Page 3:
Superintendent’s Circular FAM-02 
Page 3 of 14 
 
● Develop, review annually, and approve the School-Parent 
Compact as required by Title I. 
● Receive information about all outside programs or outside 
professionals that come into the school. 
● Approve waivers. 
As the central governing body at the school, the SSC oversees all 
school-based committees, including the ILT and the Personnel 
Subcommittee.  
The role of the ILT is to: 
● Serve as an advisory body to the principal/head of school on 
issues related to teaching and learning, assessment, and 
professional development. 
● Give a report each month to the SSC on ILT activities. 
● Seek and receive SSC approval for any ILT recommendation 
that alters the Quality School Plan or may have a major 
effect on the school community. 
Each school must elect a Personnel Subcommittee, whose 
composition must include two teachers, one parent, and the 
principal/head of school. The responsibilities of the Personnel 
Subcommittee are to: 
● Approve the hiring of new BTU teacher bargaining unit staff 
and in-transfer of BTU teachers’ bargaining unit staff from 
other schools in the system and the choice of teachers from 
the excess pools. 
● Approve the selection of lead teachers, mentor teachers, 
and new athletic coaches. 
● Determine the schedule and procedures for reviewing

candidates for positions. 
Schools must submit the names of the members of the 
Personnel Subcommittee to the Office of Family and Community 
Advancement by October 31. For additional information on the 
Personnel Subcommittee, see Superintendent’s Circular FAM-04 
Personnel Subcommittee.   
SSC GOVERNANCE AND OPERATIONS 
The following provisions describe how effective SSCs should 
operate. 
1. SSC operations are governed by a BPS/BTU Joint Steering 
Committee, which includes parents and students. Any 
member of the SSC may file a complaint with the Steering 
Committee concerning the operation of the SSC at their 
school. 
2. The SSC is expected to operate as a single decision-making 
team, working together to reach consensus, as opposed to 
being individual representatives of specific constituent 
groups. 
3. Formally, decisions made by the SSC will be made by 
majority vote, with the principal/head of school voting with 
the majority.  
4. The principal/head of school is required to account in writing 
and in person (at a subsequent meeting) for any vote in 
contravention of a majority of the council. 
5. A quorum must be present to vote on issues. To constitute a 
quorum, the principal/head of school must be present as 
well as at least two teachers and two parents for SSCs with 9-
12 members and three teachers and three parents for SSCs 
with 13 or more members.  


Page 5:
Superintendent’s Circular FAM-02 
Page 5 of 14 
 
6. The principal/head of school shall serve as SSC co-chair and 
at the first meeting of the school year; the elected members 
of the SSC are encouraged to select one member (preferably 
a parent) to serve as the other co-chair.  
7. Other roles, such as note taker and any subcommittees, shall 
also be selected at the first SSC meeting of the school year. 
8. At the first SSC meeting of the year, a calendar of meetings 
for the entire school year shall be established, ensuring that 
the times and dates are convenient for all members. 
9. The agenda for the meetings shall be developed by the SSC 
co-chairs with input from other members of the SSC and the 
school community at large. 
10. Each SSC is required to pass by-laws to govern its operations. 
The by-laws must be approved or amended by two-thirds of 
the members of the bargaining unit in the school eligible to 
vote for the SSC and by two-thirds of the parents who come 
to a parent meeting. There must be at least two weeks’ 
notice for the parent meeting. 
11. All SSC meetings are subject to DESE regulations regarding 
specific law, including publicizing meeting dates in advance 
and sharing meeting minutes with the school community. 
12. On March 29, 2023, Governor Healey signed into law a 
supplemental budget bill which, among other things, 
extends the temporary provisions pertaining to the Open 
Meeting Law to March 31, 2025. These provisions allow for  
School Site Councils to meet remotely, provided that 
adequate access to the meetings is still available to the 
public.  Please see https://www.mass.gov/the-open-meeting-
law  for more information or current updates. Decisions 
about hosting in- person or virtual school-based meetings

with families for SY 24-25 should be a shared decision with 
community members.  
For additional information on SSC governance and operations, 
please contact the Office of Family and Community 
Advancement or refer to the Shared Decision-Making section of 
the collective bargaining agreement between BPS and the BTU.  
COMPOSITION OF THE SSC  
The SSC shall be composed of:  
● The principal/head of school 
● Elected members of the BTU who work more than 50% of 
their work week at that school 
● Parents of children enrolled in that school elected by the 
School Parent Council 
● Two students (high school only) enrolled in that school 
elected by the Student Government.  
The specific number of parent and teacher representatives on 
the SSC is determined by the number of BTU members employed 
at the school. The number of parent representatives on the SSC 
must be equal to the number of BTU representatives, plus the 
principal/head of school. The table below demonstrates how the 
number of teacher and parent representatives are calculated.

*Plus, the principal/head of school and, as applicable, two 
students, as outlined above.  
Schools may also select associate (non-voting) SSC members 
from community-based organizations, higher education, or 
businesses that partner closely with the school. 
Each school shall also elect each year alternate parent, teacher, 
and student members of the SSC to substitute for absent 
members of their group. Alternate members who are elected by 
BTU bargaining unit members or parents to substitute for absent 
members may also fill vacancies created by the resignation or 
removal of SSC members. 
Parents elected as SSC representatives must reflect the racial and 
ethnic diversity of the student population at the school and 
include parents of students participating in a range of 
educational programs, such as special education and related 
services and programming for English Language Learners.  
For specific information on the election process of BTU 
representatives, please refer to the Shared Decision-Making 
section of the collective bargaining agreement between BPS and 
the BTU.

SSC ELECTION PROCEDURES FOR SELECTING PARENT AND 
STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES 
The following are key points for conducting successful elections. 
● Principals/heads of school should designate an impartial 
staff person as the school’s Election Facilitator. Elections 
should not be facilitated by the principal/head of school or 
by a parent currently serving on the SPC Executive 
Committee or SSC. The Office of Family and Community 
Advancement provides training, support, and materials for 
all election facilitators, and can facilitate elections provided 
that (a) a facilitator cannot be identified from within the 
school community, and (b) the school contacts Office of 
Family and Community Advancement with the election 
date, time, and location at least two weeks in advance. 
● OFCA recommends that the school’s Family Liaison is either 
the facilitator, co-facilitator, or observer of the election. 
● Elections for SSC and SPC parent reps must happen in the 
fall of the new school year. Spring elections will no longer be 
accepted. This is to help make opportunities for 
engagement in the councils more equitable.  
● Elections should be held at the first School Parent Council 
(SPC) meeting of the year and conducted at a time that is 
convenient for parents. The SPC consists of all parents in the 
school community. See Superintendent’s Circular FAM-01 for 
additional details. 
● Election of student SSC representatives at high schools 
should be incorporated into schools’ student government 
election process. 
● Schools should be prepared to provide translation and 


Page 9:
Superintendent’s Circular FAM-02 
Page 9 of 14 
 
interpretation, as well as childcare, at the parent election 
and at the meetings as needed. 
● Parent elections typically take between 30 and 60 minutes. 
The election facilitator should be prepared to explain the 
role and purpose of the SPC and SSC, as well as provide an 
overview of each position and requirements of the election. 
● Parents or legal guardians of students currently enrolled at 
the school are eligible to be elected to the SSC. Note: 
parents/legal guardians who work at their child’s school 
cannot serve as the parent representative on the SSC. 
● Parents may be nominated and elected to serve on both the 
SSC and the SPC executive committee/team. 
● All families who are present at the election are allowed one 
vote per family per elected position. No absentee ballots will 
be accepted. 
● Voting may be conducted by secret ballot or by majority 
vote.  
● Upon completion of voting, each newly elected parent 
should complete an Elected Member Information Form and 
return it to the election facilitator. 
● After the election, the school is responsible for submitting all 
election results to the Office of Family and Community 
Advancement 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCHOOL PARENT COUNCIL AND 
SCHOOL SITE COUNCIL 
The School Parent Council elects parent members to represent 
the parent voice on the School Site Council. The SSC 
representatives are members of the SPC Executive Committee 
and should attend SPC meetings to provide regular updates on 


Page 10:
Superintendent’s Circular FAM-02 
Page 10 of 14 
 
the SSC proceedings to ensure opportunities for parent input and 
feedback. All SSC meetings are open to the public; therefore, any 
parent, staff person, or community member can attend. However, 
only the elected representatives can vote on SSC decisions.
