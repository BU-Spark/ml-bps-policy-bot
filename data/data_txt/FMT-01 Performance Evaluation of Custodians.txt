Superintendent’s 
Circular 
NUMBER: 
FMT-01 
Version 01 
 
 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF CUSTODIANS 
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version.  
The purpose of this circular is to set forth the individuals 
responsible for custodian evaluations and to outline the 
philosophy, objectives, guidelines, and procedures applicable to 
the process.  
The contract between the School Committee and the Custodians 
Union provides for the annual evaluation of the performance of 
custodians by principals and heads of school. To assist in the 
implementation of the performance evaluation process, the 
Department of Facilities Management (Building Services) has 
developed a handbook for custodians, principals, and heads of 
schools. The evaluation process relates to the job duties and 
responsibilities of the position as contained in the handbook. 
It is the supervisor's responsibility to clearly communicate the 
specific duties associated with the position, in writing, to the 
custodial employee. Therefore, principals and heads of school 
should take all steps to become familiar with the contents of the 
handbook and should ensure that each custodian understands 
the content of the manual.  
Heads of school, principals, and other administrative heads are 
responsible for the evaluation of the performance of all custodial

employees under their supervision. However, the actual 
evaluation must be done by the immediate supervisor, i.e., the 
principal/head of school is responsible for the evaluation of both 
senior and junior custodians. During the school year, all custodial 
employees, with input by the senior custodian and Facilities 
Management, will be evaluated using the diagnostic-prescriptive 
approach and the procedures and forms developed for the 
implementation thereof.  
Training on the performance evaluation process will be provided 
during the school year. Principals and heads of schools are 
encouraged to consult with the Department of Facilities 
Management (Building Services) on all performance issues 
affecting custodial employees. The evaluation process itself is 
modeled on the teacher evaluation procedures.  
PHILOSOPHY  
The Boston Public Schools recognizes that the quality of 
educational service provided depends upon the professional 
performance and total job effectiveness of all employees in the 
system. Thus, since custodial employees can and should be held 
accountable for the quality of their performance, a just and 
effective process for evaluating that performance is essential. 
True performance evaluations involve analyses of an individual's 
strengths and weaknesses, resulting in diagnoses and 
prescriptions.  This in turn leads to the desired improvement of 
skills and improved performance of the custodial employee. 
An effective performance evaluation program is one that is 
continuous rather than periodic, and organized to:  


Page 3:
Superintendent’s Circular FMT-01 
Page 3 of 14 
 
 
 
● Develop in the support staff a clearer understanding of the 
goals of the department or school. 
● Assist employees to address more effectively the needs of 
each school or department. 
● Encourage cooperative staff relations through mutual trust 
and respect for each employee's individual role.  
The contract with the Custodians Association further provides for 
the principal/head of school and the senior custodian to establish 
a mutually supportive relationship, and to cooperate in the 
resolution of all plant maintenance and operation problems. 
Further, the contract clearly provides that the principal/head of 
school of a school building will oversee all staff and has the 
responsibility to ensure the cleanliness and maintenance of the 
school building at all times. Each custodian in a school is 
managed by the principal/head of school of that building.  
A diagnostic-prescriptive evaluation program is positively 
directed and encourages staff to maximize unique strengths and 
skills. This evaluation program encourages staff to participate in 
the evaluation of their own performance and to help set 
objectives for self-improvement. The performance evaluation 
process, however, is not intended to be a substitute for the day-
to-day communication and supervision of employees. 
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  
Heads of schools, principals, and other administrative heads have 
primary responsibility for the evaluation of all staff in their 
responsibility centers. After the evaluation has been presented to 
the employee, the evaluation form must be signed by the 


Page 4:

Page 4 of 14 
 
 
 
employee (refer to the evaluation instrument) prior to submission 
to the Office of Human Capital and Office of Facilities 
Management (Building Services). Performance evaluation 
activities may include but are not limited to: 1) preliminary 
planning conferences, 2) daily observations, 3) notations, 4) 
formal interim evaluations, 5) follow-up conferences, and 6) 
recommendations to the staff member by the evaluator. 
Principals/heads of school must evaluate both senior and junior 
custodians, in writing, and sign the completed written 
evaluations.  
PROCEDURAL STEPS  
Preliminary Procedures  
Prior to the implementation of the process, the principal/head of 
school must prepare the work schedule in cooperation with the 
senior custodian(s). They should then meet with the senior 
custodian to provide an orientation to the performance 
evaluation process and to specific roles and responsibilities 
within that process for the upcoming year as contained in the 
work schedule. Principals and heads of school should seek 
technical assistance from area managers and the Department of 
Facilities Management (Building Services).  
The evaluator shall meet with the staff member for the purpose 
of explaining the diagnostic-prescriptive evaluation process, 
including a description of all components of the evaluation 
process.

Diagnosis and Prescription 
The performance evaluation process should provide each 
custodial staff member with an appraisal of the individual's 
strengths and identify areas in need of improvement. The 
employee will be evaluated on each standard within the various 
categories:  
● U - UNSATISFACTORY: The employee fails to meet the job 
description and their performance needs improvement.  
● S - SATISFACTORY: The employee meets the job description 
and their performance, as measured against this standard, is 
satisfactory.  
● G - GOOD: The employee meets and/or generally exceeds 
the standards and their performance, as measured against 
this standard, is good.  
● E - EXCELLENT: The employee exceeds standards and their 
performance as measured against this standard, is excellent.  
Every formal evaluation must result in a mark for each 
appropriate item on the performance evaluation form. In any 
area where the supervisor indicates a need for improvement, 
they will provide the employee with a written prescription. The 
diagnosis and subsequent prescription should be fully descriptive 
and instructive, suggesting specific remedies or 
recommendations for adoption by the employee. During the 
entire evaluation process, continuous administrative assistance, 
support, and encouragement should be extended to assist the 
employee in meeting established objectives. The employee may 
suggest additional or alternative prescriptions.

Evaluation Conference  
The employee's supervisor shall meet with the staff member for 
the purpose of discussing the evaluation. During the conference, 
the staff member will be shown the written evaluation and will 
sign it to indicate that it has been seen but not to indicate 
agreement or disagreement with its contents. The staff member 
will be allowed to attach comments to the evaluation. One copy 
of the written evaluation must be given to the employee, and a 
second signed copy must be retained and filed with the assistant 
director of Facilities Management (Building Services). In any area 
that has been identified as being unsatisfactory, the 
principal/head of school should consult with the appropriate 
operational leader.  
INTERIM REPORTS  
If an unsatisfactory evaluation is issued for any item, the 
immediate supervisor must evaluate the staff member at least 
once a month until the individual's performance is judged to be 
satisfactory (see Section V).  
Principals/heads of school must submit a copy of the written 
evaluation of any employee who has received a mark of 
unsatisfactory in any item indicated on the form to the assistant 
director of Facilities Management (Building Services). 
Administrators must submit the evaluations directly to the 
assistant director of Facilities Management (Building Services).  
Any subsequent unsatisfactory evaluation must also be 
forwarded.  
➤ All evaluations must be completed by August 31 of each year.

SUMMATIVE REPORTS  
● 
At the end of each evaluation period, the principal/head of school and other administrators 
should retain copies of all evaluations and send copies to the team leader/Human Resources 
and assistant director of Facilities Management (Building Services).  
● 
If, at the conclusion of a prescriptive period (normally at the end of an evaluation period, but in 
any event at most one month after the last evaluation), the supervisor judges an employee's 
overall performance as unsatisfactory, the supervisor shall submit to the superintendent or 
designee and to the assistant director of Facilities Management (Building Services) a written 
report based on the series of evaluations.  
● 
Continued failure on the part of an employee to meet a standard will result in possible 
disciplinary action.  
PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE  
If a principal/head of school determines that an employee has 
committed an infraction of work rules such as excessive 
tardiness, absences, etc., the supervisor should follow procedures 
outlined in Superintendent's Circular: Procedures Relating to the 
Discipline of Employees. Additionally, the supervisor should 
consider the infraction in evaluating the employee's overall 
performance. Principals and heads of school may issue discipline 
only up to and including letters of reprimand. The director of 
Facilities Management or other designees of the superintendent 
issue discipline beyond this level.  
Failure to address job performance problems of assigned staff 
through the performance evaluation process represents 
unacceptable performance on the part of the supervisor. This 
problem is further compounded when "problem staff” is given a 
satisfactory rating by the supervisor and encouraged to transfer 
to another school/department. Such failure on the part of a 
supervisor represents "unsatisfactory" administrative

performance on the part of that person, who may be held 
accountable by the appropriate supervisor.
