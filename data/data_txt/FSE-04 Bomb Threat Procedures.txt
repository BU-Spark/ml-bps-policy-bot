Version 01 
 
 
 
BOMB THREAT PROCEDURES 
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
A bomb threat falsely reporting the existence of an incendiary or 
explosive device (simulated or real) is an offense punishable by 
imprisonment for up to twenty (20) years and/or a fine of not 
more than $10,000. In the event of a bomb threat, a building 
administrator must exercise responsible judgment and authority, 
keeping in mind their responsibility for the safety and well-being 
of the students and staff. To do this, one must (1) get all the facts 
and (2) follow the procedures outlined herein, developed in 
accordance with the policies of the Boston Public Schools and 
the Boston Police Department. 
BOMB THREAT PROCEDURES 
Upon the receipt of a bomb threat, principals/heads of school and 
building administrators are instructed to act in accordance with 
the following procedures: 
Telephoned Bomb Threats: 
1. When taking the call, use the attached Bomb Threat Report 
Form (Attachment A) to record all information. This form 
must be available at the main telephone(s) in the school and 
should be completed immediately after reporting the threat

to the building administrator. A copy of the Bomb Threat 
Report Form is also to be submitted with the incident 
report. 
2. Call the Boston Police Department at 911 and report the 
incident. If the bomb threat is a 2nd or 3rd call, please note 
this in your conversation with the 911 operator. 
3. Call the Department of Safety Services/Boston School Police 
at (617) 635-8000. 
4. Call your operational superintendent.  
5. Alert staff via the school’s internal communication method 
(ref. Superintendent’s Circular FSE-1 School 
Safety/Contingency Plans, Tier I, Containment Procedures) 
to visually survey their room/office for suspicious packages. 
If anything unusual is observed, immediately report this 
information to the building administrator and update 
Boston Police via 911 that something unusual has actually 
been found. 
Designated members of the School’s Safety Team will be 
responsible to survey unsupervised common areas, both 
internal and external. During this survey, all bells/classes will 
be held until the search is completed. 
6. In the event a suspicious package or device is found: 
a. Report the sighting to the building administrator 
immediately. 
b. Do not move, touch, or handle objects. 
c. Do not use two-way radios. 
d. Do not turn off lights or touch switches. 
e. Keep loud noise to a minimum.

f. Restrict use of telephone to urgent business only. 
g. Move people from the area. 
h. EVACUATE the school building.  
The Police Department will be fully in charge. This action 
is to be preceded by an announcement which provides 
specific evacuation routes to be followed for the incident 
and manner in which the evacuation signal will be given 
(fire alarm, bell, intercom, and runner). 
7. If no suspicious package or device is found, appropriate safe 
mode procedures are to be followed. However, classes 
should not be changed until the BPD Bomb Squad has 
arrived and evaluated the situation. IF YOU HAVE ANY 
DOUBTS, EVACUATE. 
8. The Police Department will assist the person in charge of 
the building when searching for bombs or other incendiary 
devices. Appropriate school personnel should assist, as 
necessary.  
9. The Police Department will assist and advise the person in 
charge of the building regarding resumption of regular 
school schedule and activities. The operational leader and 
Safety Office must be notified once a decision is made. 
10. Send a complete incident report within 24 hours of the 
incident to the Department of Safety Services. Attach a copy 
of the Bomb Threat Report Form noted above to the 
Incident Reporting Form (attached for your reference).

EVACUATION AND RE-ENTRY PROCEDURES 
The principal/head of school or building administrator must 
develop specific evacuation and re-entry plans for their individual 
buildings (c.f. Superintendent’s Circular FSE-01 School 
Safety/Contingency Plan). A copy of these plans should be 
included in each school’s Contingency Plans. Such procedural 
plans should include the following: 
1. 
Instruction of office staff regarding proper procedures for 
answering, documenting, and reporting of such 
telephone calls. 
2. 
Method of notifying staff and students of emergency 
conditions. 
3. 
Method of leaving the building (fire drill procedures may 
be followed). Special attention should be given to identify 
assembly points, which are recommended to be located 
300 yards from the building when evacuating for a

suspected bomb. Any area that is being used as a 
staging or assembly area must be searched by a 
designated staff member prior to sending people to that 
area. 
4. 
Specific plans for special needs and physically impaired 
students. 
5. 
Supervision of students by classroom teachers at all times 
while outside the building (prior planning should be done 
with local police authorities in schools that would require 
extra police surveillance and supervision outside that 
school). 
6. 
Controlled re-entry of the building to include supervision 
of students re-entering to insure that no potentially 
dangerous objects are brought into the building. 
These procedures should be utilized in conjunction with your 
School Safety / Contingency Plans.
