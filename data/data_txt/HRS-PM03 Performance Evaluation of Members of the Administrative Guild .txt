PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF MEMBERS OF THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE GUILD 
The following sets forth the philosophy, roles, responsibilities, and 
procedures applicable to the evaluation process for members of 
the Administrative Guild. 
I. COVERAGE 
The contract between the School Committee and the 
Administrative Guild provides for both annual and interim 
evaluations of the performance of all employees represented by 
the Guild. The evaluation process relates to the duties and 
responsibilities of the employee’s position, as set forth in the 
employee’s job description. 
The job descriptions are general in nature and are not intended 
to change any employee’s existing responsibilities. The format of 
the job descriptions allows supervisors to determine the specific 
job duties associated with the position’s classification. 
The supervisor should obtain a copy of the appropriate job 
description and provide it to each employee under their 
jurisdiction. The supervisor should also communicate clearly to 
the employee the specific duties associated with the position as 
well as any additional information pertaining to the position. 
Members of the Administrative Guild can also contact their OHC 
Staffing Manager to access job descriptions.

II. PHILOSOPHY 
The Boston Public Schools recognizes that the quality of 
educational service depends upon the professional performance 
and total job effectiveness of all employees. Since clerical and 
technical employees can and should be held accountable for the 
quality of their performance, a just and effective process for 
evaluating that performance is essential. True performance 
evaluation involves an analysis of an employee's strengths and 
weaknesses, resulting in diagnoses and prescriptions that lead to 
the desired improvement of skills and performance. 
All clerical and technical employees will be evaluated using the 
diagnostic-prescriptive approach, and the procedures and forms 
developed for the implementation of this approach. 
A diagnostic-prescriptive evaluation program is positively 
directed and encourages employees to maximize their unique 
strengths and skills. It encourages employees to participate in 
the evaluation of their own performance and to help set 
objectives for self-improvement. The performance evaluation 
process, however, is not intended to be a substitute for the day-
to-day communication with and supervision of employees. 
An effective performance evaluation program is one that is 
continuous rather than periodic and organized to: 
● develop a clear understanding of the goals of the 
department or school; 
● assist employees in addressing more effectively the needs 
of each school or department; and 
● encourage cooperative staff relations through mutual trust 
and respect for each employee's role.

III. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
Heads of school, principals, and other administrative heads have 
chief responsibility for the evaluation of all staff in their 
responsibility centers. Performance evaluations must be 
conducted by the employee's most immediate supervisor who is 
not a member of the Guild bargaining unit. 
A supervisor’s failure to address the job performance problems of 
their staff through the performance evaluation process 
represents unacceptable performance for which the supervisor 
will be held accountable. 
Further, a supervisor will also be performing unsatisfactorily if an 
underperforming staff member is given a satisfactory rating and 
then encouraged to transfer to another school or department. A 
supervisor who does this will be held accountable as part of their 
performance evaluation. 
IV. DIAGNOSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
The performance evaluation process should provide each 
employee with an appraisal of their strengths and identify areas 
in need of improvement. The employee will be evaluated on each 
standard within the various categories. There are four possible 
ratings: 
 
E – EXEMPLARY: 
The employee’s performance of the duties and 
responsibilities of their position exceeds 
expectations. 
P – PROFICIENT: 
The employee’s performance of the duties and 
responsibilities of their position meets 
expectations. 


Page 4:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PM03 
Page 4 of 21 
 
N – NEEDS 
IMPROVEMENT: 
The employee’s performance of the duties and 
responsibilities of their position needs 
improvement. 
U – UNSATISFACTORY: 
The employee has failed to meet expectations 
and their performance of the duties and 
responsibilities of their position needs 
improvement. 
Every interim and annual evaluation must result in a mark for 
each appropriate item on the evaluation form. In any area where 
the supervisor indicates a need for improvement, they will 
provide the employee with a written prescription within the 
evaluation document. The diagnosis and subsequent 
prescription should be fully descriptive and instructive, 
suggesting specific remedies or recommendations for adoption 
by the employee. The employee may suggest additional or 
alternative prescriptions. 
V. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
The performance of employees represented by the Guild 
bargaining unit is evaluated annually. The evaluation year is from 
July 1 to June 30 for each employee. 
Performance evaluation activities may include, but are not 
limited to, preliminary planning conferences, daily observations, 
notations, formal interim evaluations, follow-up conferences, and 
recommendations to the employee by the evaluator. 
During the entire evaluation process, continuous administrative 
assistance, support, and encouragement should be extended to 
assist the employee in meeting established objectives. 


Page 5:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PM03 
Page 5 of 21 
 
STEP 1 – PRELIMINARY PROCEDURES 
At the beginning of each evaluation year, the head of school, 
principal, or other administrative head should meet with their 
supervisory staff to orient them to the performance evaluation 
process and to their roles and responsibilities within that process 
for the upcoming year. Guild members will be evaluated by their 
most direct supervisor or designee who is not a member of the 
Guild bargaining unit. 
For all new employees or after a change in supervision, the 
evaluator must meet with the employee no later than 30 days 
after the start of the evaluation year to discuss and explain the 
evaluation process, the evaluation instrument, and to clarify the 
responsibilities and objectives of the position. 
The evaluator and the Guild member will sign the evaluation 
instrument indicating the date of such meeting. 
STEP 2 – PREPARE DIAGNOSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS (AS 
NEEDED) 
If at any time, including at the interim evaluation meeting (see 
step 3), a supervisor finds that an employee needs major 
improvement in their job performance or in accomplishing any 
goal, the supervisor will prepare a written diagnosis of the 
situation, recommendations for improvement, and will share this 
feedback with the employee within a reasonable amount of time. 
STEP 3 – INTERIM EVALUATION PROCEDURES 
All new employees or employees under new supervision should 
receive an interim evaluation no later than November 15, if 
reasonably possible. All other employees will be evaluated a 
minimum of one time during the school year. However, to 
receive a rating of “Unsatisfactory” in any category on an annual 


Page 6:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PM03 
Page 6 of 21 
 
evaluation, an interim evaluation must have been previously 
conducted. 
If an interim evaluation includes a rating(s) of Unsatisfactory 
and/or Needs Improvement in any category, then the supervisor 
will communicate in writing the reasons for the rating(s) of 
Unsatisfactory and/or Needs Improvement within the evaluation 
form and provide prescriptions for improvement. A follow-up 
evaluation or evaluations for an interim overall unsatisfactory 
evaluation must be done after a minimum of 20 school days and 
no later than 50 school days from the last evaluation during 
which a member is present. All initial “Unsatisfactory” interim 
evaluations should have a follow-up evaluation no less than 20 
school days during which the employee is present. 
The same form is used for interim and annual evaluations. 
STEP 4 – POST INTERIM MEETING EVALUATION CONFERENCE 
Within ten (10) working days in which the employee is present 
following the completion of an interim evaluation document, the 
evaluator will meet with the employee to discuss the evaluation. 
During this conference, the evaluation and a copy of it will be 
provided to the employee, who will sign both the original and the 
copy to indicate that they have seen and acknowledged it, but 
not to indicate agreement or disagreement with its contents. The 
supervisor must retain the signed copy. The employee has a right 
to attach a written response to the evaluation. 
If an employee receives a mark of Needs Improvement or 
Unsatisfactory on any item on their performance evaluation form, 
the principal, head of school, or other administrative head must 
immediately submit this evaluation form to the Office of Human 
Resources. 


Page 7:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PM03 
Page 7 of 21 
 
Interim evaluations will not be placed in the employee’s 
permanent file. 
STEP 5 – ANNUAL EVALUATION PROCEDURES 
Annual evaluations must be completed no later than June 1 of 
each year. 
If an evaluation includes a rating(s) of Unsatisfactory and/or 
Needs Improvement in any category, then the supervisor will 
communicate in writing the reasons for the rating(s) of 
Unsatisfactory and/or Needs Improvement within the evaluation 
form and provide prescriptions for improvement. However, to 
receive a rating of “Unsatisfactory” in any category on an annual 
evaluation, an interim evaluation must have been previously 
conducted. If an employee received a Needs Improvement or 
Unsatisfactory rating on any item on the form, the Principal, 
Head of School, other Administrative Head must immediately 
submit this evaluation form to The Office of Human Resources. 
STEP 6 – POST ANNUAL EVALUATION CONFERENCE 
Within ten (10) working days in which the employee is present 
following the completion of any evaluation document, the 
evaluator will meet with the employee to discuss the evaluation. 
During this conference, the evaluation and a copy of it will be 
provided to the employee, who will sign both the original and the 
copy to indicate that they have seen and acknowledged it, but 
not to indicate agreement or disagreement with its contents. The 
employee has the right to attach a written response to the 
evaluation form. 
If an employee receives an annual overall Unsatisfactory 
evaluation, the supervisor may initiate termination by 
recommending to the Superintendent that such employee be 


Page 8:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PM03 
Page 8 of 21 
 
terminated. 
STEP 7 – SUBMIT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION FORMS TO THE 
OFFICE OF HUMAN RESOURCES 
At the end of each evaluation year, the principal, head of school, 
or other administrative head should retain the copies of all 
evaluations and send/deliver the originals of all evaluations to the 
Office of Human Resources front desk. If the performance 
evaluation is overall Unsatisfactory, a copy should also be sent to 
the director of evaluation and performance management, Office 
of Human Resources. 
Note: An employee with an “Unsatisfactory” performance 
evaluation has no bidding rights until that employee receives a 
subsequent “satisfactory” performance evaluation. For the 
purposes of this section, an “Unsatisfactory” evaluation means an 
unsatisfactory rating in any two areas on an interim or annual 
evaluation. 
VI. PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE 
If a principal, head of school, or other administrative head 
determines that an employee has committed an infraction of 
work rules such as excessive tardiness, absences, etc., the 
supervisor should follow the procedures outlined in the 
Superintendent's Circular on Employee Discipline Procedures. 
Additionally, the supervisor should consider the infraction in 
evaluating the employee's overall performance.
