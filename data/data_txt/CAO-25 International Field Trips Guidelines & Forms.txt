NUMBER: 
CAO-25 
DATE: 
Version 01 
 
GUIDELINES FOR INTERNATIONAL FIELD TRIPS  
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: *These guidelines might be impacted by 
COVID-19 restrictions and are subject to change based on public 
health, international security, or other emergent issues that 
could impact travel. For the most up-to-date information and 
guidance, contact the Department of Global Education 
(kdorseytwumasi2@bostonpublicschools.org) for 
assistance/guidance.  
This Superintendent’s Circular provides instructions for 
implementing the Field Trip Policy passed by the Boston School 
Committee on November 20, 2019. 
● This circular should be read AFTER the Superintendent’s 
Circular CAO-22, General Guidelines and Procedures for All 
Field Trips, as additional guidelines are outlined there. 
● The principal/head of school (and/or the district 
department lead sponsoring the trip) are responsible for 
ensuring that all field trip policies and procedures as 
outlined in this circular and others are adhered to. 
● As soon as a trip opportunity becomes known, contact the 
Department of Global Education for support throughout 
the planning process. The principal/head of school (and/or 


Page 2:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 2 of 104 
the district department sponsoring the trip) and the 
program leader (lead chaperone) must review and 
complete checklists for this circular throughout the 
planning process. Signed checklists must be kept on file at 
the school. 
PLANNING PROCESS 
International Field Trip Program: An international field trip 
program is any trip off school grounds that involves travel to a 
location outside of the United States. International field trips 
must be planned at least a year in advance to maximize 
affordability and fundraising efforts, and when possible, 
scheduled during non-school time (i.e., school vacations, and 
summer). NEW: BPS international field trip programs require 
execution by a reputable travel vendor and will require a vetting 
process by the Department of Global Education and BPS legal.   
Travel to ‘U. S. Territories, including Puerto Rico, the United States 
Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana 
Islands are covered under international travel insurance. Travel to 
these territories is subject to some forms and requirements in the 
CAO-25 International Field Trip guidelines, but only require 
Principal/Head of School approval. Consult with the Department 
of Global Education for required forms for these destinations. 
APPROVAL PROCESS  
• STEP 1: Interest Form & Consultation:  
As soon as a trip opportunity becomes known, or there is 
interest in an international travel program, teachers must 
complete an Interest Form from the Department of Global 
Education, and inform their principal/head of school. 


Page 3:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 3 of 104 
Contact the Department of Global Education for support 
and guidance with the CAO-25 application, and throughout 
the planning process. No arrangements should be made, 
meetings held, payments, or deposits made without 
consultation with the Department of Global Education and 
formal application approval from the Superintendent.  
• STEP 2: CAO-25 Application 
After consulting with the Department of Global Education 
and head of school, the CAO-25 application shall be 
submitted to the Director of Global Education no less than 
10-12 months before departure.  The proposal and official 
application must be completed, reviewed by the 
principal/head of school, and endorsed with an official letter 
from them. The application then requires approval by the 
Department of Global Education, which will then seek 
approval from the appropriate district leaders, before 
obtaining final approval from the Superintendent. Again, No 
arrangements should be made, payments or deposits 
placed without approval first from the Superintendent. You 
cannot gauge student interest or engage with families 
without program approval. District leadership and/or the 
Superintendent may have questions about your application 
or ask that aspects of the proposal be changed or removed.  
• STEP 3: Approval 
Once the CAO-25 application is approved by the 
Superintendent, in consult with your principal/head of 
school, you may begin to promote the international 
program to students, families, and your school community. 
Should your itinerary, roster, or any other aspect of your 
approved application package change, you must notify the 


Page 4:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 4 of 104 
Department of Global Education in writing as soon as 
possible.  
SAFETY PREPAREDNESS  
• Travel Advisories/Warnings: Travel to countries cited as a 
Level 3 or 4 in the United States Department of State Travel 
Warning Listing or the Center for Disease Control (CDC) are 
prohibited. For countries listed as a Level 2, consult the 
Department of Global Education in advance. The Boston 
Public Health Commission and Department of Global 
Education will continue to monitor country destinations for 
safety. The program leader, principal/head of school are also 
responsible for checking the State Department and CDC 
throughout the trip planning process as levels change. 
Please note: The Superintendent reserves the right to cancel 
any field trip up to and including the day of departure to 
manage risk. 
• Insurance: Through On Call International insurance, the 
district provides medical coverage for international BPS 
sponsored trips for BPS students, BPS staff participants, and 
chaperones. On Call will serve as the primary source for 
medical insurance while abroad.  However, in some cases, if 
a hospital visit is required, students may be required to pay 
out of pocket, and be reimbursed by On Call later. Families 
will want to budget for this just-in-case expense.  
The On Call insurance policy does NOT include cancellation 
or trip interruption insurance should the trip be canceled or 
interrupted for any reason other than medical. 
Cancellation/interruption must be due to the traveler 
getting sick, injured, or someone in the traveler’s immediate 


Page 5:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 5 of 104 
family being sick, injured, or death. Students/Families would 
need to show proof of a sickness/injury and the 
sickness/injury must be so disabling as to cause them to 
cancel/interrupt their trip. If there is a sickness/death for 
their family member they would need to show proof of that 
too. Save all receipts for flights/lodging for reimbursement 
purposes and a claim form would need to be filled out. 
Families will need to know in advance that Trip Cancellation 
has a $2,000 limit, and Trip Interruption has a $2,500 limit.  
Again, the superintendent reserves the right to cancel a trip 
for any reason and at any time for safety purposes–Cancel 
for Any Reason Insurance (CFAR) is NOT provided by the 
district.  Therefore, all trip participants are strongly 
encouraged to purchase their own (CFAR) insurance to 
protect their trip investment. 
On Call International provides overseas evacuation 
insurance (enabling students who become seriously ill or for 
whom there is some kind of emergency to be returned to 
the United States). On Call International must coordinate, 
approve, and perform the evacuation.   Emergency family 
travel arrangements are covered up to a limit if the traveler 
is hospitalized for 2 or more days. 
• Informed Parental Consent, Associated Risks, and 
Indemnity:  Families must sign the customized Informed 
Parental Consent, Associated Risks, and Indemnity form 
explicitly developed for their travel program by the director 
of Global Education and BPS Legal in collaboration with the 
program leader. The program leader is responsible for 
initiating this form based on a template provided from the 
Department of Global Education.  


Page 6:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 6 of 104 
• District Training: Program leaders must attend training for 
effective in-field risk management and response practice. 
This training is offered by the district once per year. Please 
email the Department of Global Education for details. If you 
miss the training, you must schedule a meeting with DGE to 
supplement.  
o While this training is mandatory for program leaders, it 
is recommended that one additional chaperone from 
the team attend the training with the program leader. 
However, in cases where other chaperones (non-
program leaders) are not able to attend the in-person 
training (due to budget, space, or scheduling), it is 
expected that they will receive training and 
information from pre-travel meetings/virtual webinars, 
and guidance from the Department of Global 
Education and program leader in preparation for their 
role. All chaperones will be required to review this 
document and participate in pre-travel meetings with 
the Department of Global Education. 
o CPR & First Aid: At least two chaperones (including the 
program leader) must hold valid CPR AND first aid 
certification. The district will offer this training at least 
once per year for program leaders. Please email the 
Department of Global Education for details. Ensure the 
availability of a first aid kit/supplies from the 
Department of Global Education. Verify emergency and 
medical information and contact details. 
• STEP Program: Program leaders, or parents must register 
students and chaperones through the U.S. State 
Department’s STEP (Smart Traveler Enrollment Program) 
program. If you have non-U.S. citizens traveling with your 


Page 7:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 7 of 104 
group, contact their respective embassies to see what 
services they would provide these individuals in the event of 
an emergency. U.S. embassies abroad do not necessarily 
assist non-U.S. citizens in emergencies overseas.  
• Transportation: School buses or BPS approved 
transportation vendors’ vehicles MUST be used to transport 
students to and from field trips or athletic events, regardless 
of how the trip is paid for. Privately owned vehicles, vehicles 
from non-approved vendors, ride sharing transportation 
services such as Uber and Lyft, or leased vans are not to be 
utilized to transport students to and from field trips or 
athletic events, except in the case of a bona fide medical 
emergency. Refer to TRN-03 and CAO-22 for information 
and regulations on field trip transportation. 
• Itineraries: Upon advance review of itineraries, BPS reserves 
the right to deny schools to participate in field trip activities 
on their itinerary where the risks of the activity outweighs 
the intended learning outcomes of the program. The 
program leader, in collaboration with the chaperone team, 
are required to submit a risk analysis for each part of the 
program that identifies the top 5 risks/concerns associated 
with the program.

MEDICAL PREPARATION FOR SAFE TRAVEL 
• Doctor’s Visit: Prior to the trip, all students and chaperones 
must inform their primary care doctor/travel clinic doctor of 
their trip location and have had a recent doctor’s visit and 
physical exam prior to departure. If any student has a 
serious medical or mental health condition, please be sure 
that their doctor writes a letter indicating that the child may 
safely attend and participate in trip activities. There are 
certain locations in the world where entry requires specific 
vaccinations, immunizations, and medications necessary for 
healthy travel--in those cases--all participants will be 
required to obtain those vaccinations, immunizations, and 
medications.  
• Medical Documentation: Chaperones must document and 
carry all students’ medical information, including any 
specialized immunizations or medications required by their 
doctors for travel. Participants are also required to list all 


Page 9:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 9 of 104 
medications that might be prescribed with this particular 
program in mind along with the other medications that 
they may take regularly.  Program leaders should send a 
final email to all participants to check on additional 
medications added before departure. 
• School Nurse & Counselor Review: The program leader 
must consult with the school leader to determine if, and 
what type of medical assistance is needed for participating 
students. To ensure accessibility, this step is crucial, and 
must take place before the field trip is secured. For 
additional questions, please consult the Health Services 
Department. Additionally, to thoroughly support a student's 
participation in a field trip, at least six weeks before 
departure (much longer for international and overnight field 
trip programs), consult with and, when necessary, receive 
training from the school nurse regarding any students who 
have medical needs. Also consult with the school counselor 
regarding mental and behavioral health needs. If any 
student has a serious medical or mental health condition, be 
sure that their doctor is aware of the essential participation 
criteria and location of the trip and writes a letter indicating 
that the child may safely attend and participate in trip 
activities. Keep this document on file with other key 
permissions slips and medical forms. 
• Nurse Verification Form: Review all students’ medical forms 
with the school nurse and guidance counselor to ensure all 
documents are completed and to be sure you are in the 
strongest position to support each student’s health while 
abroad. School nurses and counselors do not “clear” 
students for travel but will provide chaperones with 
guidance in supporting students while traveling. Consult 


Page 10:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 10 of 104 
with, and when necessary, receive training from and obtain 
written comments from the school nurse regarding any 
students who have expressed medical needs. Complete and 
submit the Nurse Verification form to the Department of 
Global Education.  
CHAPERONE CRITERIA 
• Role of the Program Leader (Lead Chaperone): The 
selection and approval of all chaperones is conducted by the 
principal/head of school. The program leader is a BPS 
employee and the lead chaperone organizing and leading 
the trip. The program leader is required to have experience 
leading, or co-leading BPS students (or students from 
another district) abroad previously and has the full support 
and approval of the principal/head of school to do so. The 
program leader leads the entire school team and is the main 
representative of the group and district while abroad. The 
program leader is responsible for ensuring all guidelines in 
CAO-22 and CAO-25 are followed and keeping the 
principal/head of school and the district informed of trip 
developments. The program leader is responsible for 
completing the International Field Trip Request Form and 
accompanying documents that are submitted to the 
principal/head of school and Department of Global 
Education for approval. The program leader is also 
responsible for organizing the chaperone team, student 
team, and pre-departure meetings.  
• Chaperone Selection: Every adult on the trip must be a 
chaperone and have a clear role. 


Page 11:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 11 of 104 
o Diverse Strengths:  Choose a chaperone team 
purposefully and wisely, considering strengths and 
what each chaperone can contribute to the overall 
experience. The goal is to have a well-rounded team of 
chaperones from different areas. We recommend that 
at least one member of the chaperone team — if not 
the program leader — speak the local language of the 
country visited. For example, consider chaperones who 
have visited the country before, and one who speaks 
the local language. Additionally, consider chaperones 
who are subject matter experts in the topic being 
explored, or who have professional medical/social 
emotional health experience. Efforts should be made 
for chaperones to be representative of the student 
group and include males and females where relevant.  
o Knowledge of Students: The selection and approval of 
chaperones by the principal/head of school should also 
be based on the individuals’ knowledge of, and rapport 
with, most of the student participants.  
• Chaperone Ratios: For international programs, the student-
to-chaperone ratio is 7:1, with a two-chaperone minimum. It 
is recommended that a chaperone reserve, or backup, be 
identified in the event a chaperone is no longer able to 
participate at the last minute or must leave the field. The 
reserve chaperone should have a valid passport and visa to 
travel to the destination. Tour guides and employees of 
third-party vendors contracted to help operate the trip are 
not considered chaperones, and do not factor into the 
student to chaperone ratio. All BPS and non-BPS 
chaperones are required to sign the Chaperone Agreement 
form. Refer to CAO-22 for additional chaperone criteria.  


Page 12:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 12 of 104 
• Non-BPS Chaperones: Other authorized chaperones may 
include parents and volunteers who must be 21 years of age 
or older. All non-BPS employee chaperones must submit a 
yearly CORI/SORI authorization form to the Office of Human 
Capital. Complete the eCORI form online. Contact the BPS 
Office of Human Capital (OHC) for CORI check and 
confirmation support. The principal/head of school and the 
lead chaperone are responsible for submitting authorization 
forms to OHC and must not allow chaperones to take part in 
activities until they have been CORI/SORI cleared. Non-BPS 
employees who chaperone on a field trip are not covered for 
liability by the Boston Public Schools. 
• BPS Employee Parent Chaperones: Chaperones who are 
parents/guardians of BPS students on the trip must provide 
the same level of care and attention to ALL of the student 
participants. If a BPS chaperone’s child who does not attend 
the participating school must attend the program, the child 
must be a BPS student and in the same grade or age range 
as participating students. In this case, the BPS employee is 
responsible for incurring all costs associated with their 
child’s participation.  
PASSPORTS & VISAS  
• Check Student & Chaperone Passports: During the 
recruitment process, physically check all students’ passports 
well before your travel date to ensure that they are valid for 
travel and will be valid at least six months after your return 
date. Students must renew or apply for a first-time passport 
as soon as possible as the process can be lengthy.  


Page 13:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 13 of 104 
• Non-U.S. Passports:  Determine who holds a non-U.S. 
passport. There are many countries that do not require U.S. 
passport holders to have a visa but require them for NON-
U.S. passport holders. There are also countries that might 
require Americans to obtain a visa but do not require one for 
a non-U.S. passport holder. Identify the countries from 
which your travelers hold passports, as they might be 
questioned in customs or might have to contact other 
consulates if they lose their passports abroad. *Also plan for 
delays at border control at the airport for non-US passport 
holders.  
• Visa Requirements: Research if your destination requires a 
visa. Every country has a different application and timeline 
for obtaining a visa.  
• Parent Passports: Encourage parents to obtain valid 
passports and visas should they need to travel to the 
country for their child during an emergency.  
• Copy Passports: Copies of student and chaperone passports 
and visas must be left with families, and the principal/head 
of school.

Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 14 of 104 
STUDENT ACCESSIBILITY, PARTICIPATION, AND CONDUCT 
Student Participation: Students not enrolled in the Boston Public 
Schools may not participate. Once on the field trip, student 
participants are not permitted to leave the group to visit friends, 
relatives etc., and rejoin the group. Students must remain with 
the group at all times.  
• Essential Participation Criteria: Before student recruitment 
begins, the program leader and principal/head of school 
shall work together to establish essential participation 
criteria for the trip that informs students and parents of the 
program objectives, all of the activities and risks associated 
with each itinerary activity, and trip location, to determine 
what accommodations or modifications may need to be 
made for students to successfully and safely participation in 
all or portions of the trip.  
• Student Recruitment: By default, any program is open to all 
students. However, there may be programs that are specific 
to certain students (i.e., class, club, team, grade level specific 
trips) with the consultation of the program leader and head 
of school that keeps in mind financial accessibility, diversity, 
and equity. The recruitment process must be transparent 
and fair. The chaperone team must create an environment 
and structures to support all students. Trips must be 
advertised to all students (within the school, particular 
grade, class, or program associated with the trip), regardless 
of their financial situation. If there is a formal process for 
being enrolled on your trip, such as an application, it must 
first be approved by the head of school and have a clear 
rubric that demonstrates the essential criteria for an 
applicant. A student’s ability to pay may not be a criterion 


Page 15:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 15 of 104 
for field trip participation. If a student is denied admission to 
a trip, be prepared to speak to the student, administration, 
or family if there are questions about your selection process. 
Keep a record of all applications and decisions made.  
Accessibility 
• Field Trip Location Selection: Program leaders must 
consider their student demographics when selecting field 
trip locations, sites, and activities. The location of the trip 
must tie directly to the objectives and learning outcomes of 
the program. Specifically, determine the impact the 
locations, sites, and activities that may have on diverse 
populations such as students of color, ELL students, 
students who identify with the LGBTQIA+ community, 
students with disabilities, those who may be in the minority 
during your field trip experience, and those students who 
belong to groups that have experienced marginalization in 
the location being visited. Program leaders must work to 
prepare students for sensitive experiences and ensure that 
the program is safe and inclusive for all students. Consult 
the Department of Global Education for resources if needed.  
• Access and Inclusion: Students with English Language 
Learner status, 504 plans, and/or IEPs cannot be denied 
access to field trips due to their ability. It is the responsibility 
of the school to ensure that all accommodations normally 
provided to a student as indicated in their educational plans 
are made available during a field trip, including medication. 
See Superintendent’s Circular SHS-08 Medication 
Administration for information about medical dispensation 
on field trips. Participating students’ IEP or 504 plan shall be 


Page 16:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 16 of 104 
available to any staff coordinating and/or participating in 
the field trip to meet the child’s needs. 
• Student Health: If a student has a serious medical or mental 
health condition, please be sure that their doctor is 
informed of the essential participation criteria and location 
of the trip and writes a signed letter on letterhead indicating 
that the child may safely attend and participate in trip 
activities. The program leader must keep this document on 
file with other key permissions slips and medical forms. 
Again, also consult with your school nurse at least 6 weeks 
in advance.  
• Inclusive Accommodations: In collaboration with the 
student and their family, the program leader and 
principal/head of school shall work with transgender and 
gender nonconforming students to provide 
accommodations (including rooming) that affirm the 
student’s gender identity while also ensuring safety. 
Program leaders should work with students and families to 
make sure all travel documents (e.g., airline ticket, passport) 
reflect their legal names as listed on government issued 
identification, while all unofficial documents and materials 
may reflect the student’s preferred name. Please view 
additional rooming guidelines from the Office of Equity.  
CONDUCT  
The BPS Code of Conduct applies on all field trips. BPS students 
and parents are required to sign a BPS Student Traveler & Family 
Agreement Form regarding student conduct while participating 
in a BPS sponsored field trip. Following an investigation, if the 
program leader, in consult with the principal/head of school and 


Page 17:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 17 of 104 
Central Office staff, determines that a student’s conduct while on 
an overnight trip poses a risk to themselves or the safety of the 
group, or is no longer manageable by BPS staff in the field, the 
district reserves the right to request and arrange for that student 
to return home. The district also reserves the right to request that 
families assume responsibility for all or a portion of the costs 
associated with their child’s return. Students may be subject to 
further disciplinary action and will be provided the opportunity to 
have a formal hearing at the school level upon return. The school 
must document the parent/guardian’s consent of this policy prior 
to the trip.  
• Dismissal Transportation Protocol: If a student is to be 
dismissed from an overnight field trip, the student’s 
parent/guardian must be notified in advance and should 
agree to meet the student at the airport or other agreed 
upon destination. If the parent/guardian is not reachable, 
the student’s principal/head of school or appropriate school-
based point of contact must be notified and agree to meet 
the student at the airport or other agreed upon destination. 
Students under the age of 16 must be accompanied on their 
flight by a chaperone. Students over the age of 16 may fly 
unaccompanied, though a chaperone must accompany the 
student to the airport to ensure the student checks in for 
their flight. (Age requirements may be subject to specific 
airline/train/bus guidelines). Any costs assumed in this 
regard will be the responsibility of the parent/guardian. 
Program leaders must inform families of this protocol at or 
before initial promotional meetings.  
• Pre-departure Program Dismissal: In the event a student is 
to be dismissed from an international field trip program 
before departure, a Pre-departure Incident Report must be 


Page 18:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 18 of 104 
submitted to the Department of Global Education (DGE). A 
chaperone cannot dismiss a student from a trip without 
approval from the principal/head of school. The 
principal/head of school must approve the recommendation 
for dismissal by signing the pre-departure incident report. 
The report should then be filed with the DGE, who will 
review and file the report. Any loss of fees or deposits 
associated with early dismissal will be absorbed by the 
family, which must be communicated before any deposits 
are made by families. Program leaders must inform families 
of this protocol at or before initial promotional meetings.  
PRE-DEPARTURE MEETINGS  
• Student Meetings: Program leaders must conduct at least 
three (more are recommended) student meetings before 
departure. This does not include the mandatory parent 
meeting; however, students should be encouraged to 
attend the parent meeting as well. Meetings should review 
logistics and prepare students to be mindful, healthy, 
responsible, and safe travelers. Most programs hold many 
more meetings to prepare students for the challenges and 
rewards of the travel experience.  
• Parent Meetings: Program leaders must conduct at least 
one (more are recommended) parent/guardian meeting 
(with each family, or all families together). This does not 
include the initial meeting to promote the trip. Please note 
that if traveling to a Level 2 destination issued by the Center 
for Disease Control (CDC) or State Department, the program 
leader is required to inform parents of the medical or safety 
concerns and precautionary plan. Please consult with the 
Department of Global Education before this meeting. For 


Page 19:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 19 of 104 
information on staying healthy while traveling, go to the 
CDC page on Travelers’ Health/Medical Tourism. Your entire 
group and their families must attend a mandatory 
information session. All chaperones should be present and 
play a role in this meeting.  
• Meeting Topics: During pre-departure meetings, the 
following topics must be reviewed (others may be discussed 
at the lead chaperone’s discretion): 
○ Trip’s educational purpose 
○ Behavior expectations 
○ Detailed itinerary 
○ Review of country landscape (health, cultural norms, 
safety, and security) 
○ Insurance coverage 
○ Required travel documents  
○ Packing list  
○ Communication plan and emergency contact 
information  
○ Transportation plans and logistics  
○ Review and collect permission forms 
○ Meals and accommodations 
○ In-country transport (be specific, as modes of transport 
vary country to country) 
○ Expectations for in-country expenses and procedures 
to exchange money, if applicable 
○ Passport and visa requirements, if applicable 
○ Program provider documents.  
Contact the Department of Global Education for sample meeting 
agendas and templates and support with meeting agendas.  
Important Meeting Notes:  


Page 20:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 20 of 104 
● Document parent/family attendance.  
● Utilize zoom meetings when necessary. 
● Develop a plan for families who may need translation 
services at the meeting; students should not serve as their 
parent/guardian’s translator.  
● If a parent/guardian is unable to attend a meeting, at least 
one trip chaperone (who is a BPS employee) must 
physically meet with the parent/guardian about the trip 
before taking the student abroad. Document this private 
meeting for your records. 
Chaperone Team Meetings:  
Program leaders must conduct at least three pre-departure 
chaperone team meetings. Meeting topics to include:  
○ Assign chaperone roles for pre, during, and post trip;  
○ Review Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and insurance 
coverage;  
○ Student paperwork (Binders) 
○ Participants  
○ Student Code of Conduct Agreement 
○ The Pre-Departure Incident Report and the incident 
report form for while on the trip 
○ For non-BPS employee chaperones, review their 
knowledge of BPS policies and chaperone expectations 
○ Review detailed itinerary 
○ Distribute responsibilities

COMMUNICATION PLAN  
• International Phone Service Coverage: Program leaders 
must have international cell phone coverage for the 
duration of the trip for communication with BPS and 
families in the event of an emergency. This cell phone must 
be on at all times so you may be contacted in case of an 
emergency. If this is not possible due to your location, please 
arrange a communication plan with your principal/head of 
school and the Department of Global Education. If such 
international coverage requires you to purchase an 
international plan or to accrue additional costs due to the 
trip, please submit your receipts to the BPS Finance Office 
for reimbursement. Program leaders must also carry the 
phone numbers for the principal/head of school or 


Page 22:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 22 of 104 
sponsoring district department, and the Department of 
Global Education. You are required to call your head of 
school and the Department of Global Education anytime 
there is an emergency.  
• District Communication: Codify a clear communication plan 
with your principal/head of school or sponsoring district 
department, and the Director of Global Education prior to 
departure. The director of Global Education will initiate a 
group chat with the program leader, and head of school on 
WhatsApp. You must check in with the Director of Global 
Education via phone, text (download WhatsApp for free for 
messaging), or email upon arrival, every 48 hours, whenever 
the itinerary significantly changes, whenever you expect to 
lose cell/email coverage, upon departure, and upon safe 
return. You MUST check in via phone call to your Head of 
School and the Department of Global Education when there 
is an incident.

whom to call 24/7 in case of an emergency. If you need 
support in family communication before, during, and after 
the trip, contact the Department of Global Education.  
• Communication with Students: Set and remind students 
and families of the expectations for social media usage 
while abroad. Discuss what is, and is not acceptable for 
posting, recording, and sharing on social media. Make clear 
the boundaries, confidentiality, and privacy of other

responsibility to make adjustments in the interest of 
group/individual safety. Consult the Department of Global 
Education during the trip when you have questions 
regarding trip safety. 
● Conduct Safety Reviews with Students in the Field: The 
following topics must be reviewed with students:  
○ Program leaders conduct a fire and safety assessment 
and fire drill (Fire Prevention and Safety Instructions) 
when you arrive at EACH NEW accommodation. Share 
the assessment with the chaperone team and prepare 
for orientation and fire drill. 
○ Share evacuation plan and emergency plans. Discuss 
where students go during an emergency or otherwise. 


Page 29:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 29 of 104 
Discuss where students go if they are separated from 
the group during an activity.  
○ Ensure students have a list of the key addresses 
(hotel/chaperone/host family contact information) and 
emergency information for the US and the 
international destination as well as copies of all travel 
documents. Share where you are staying (room 
number if applicable) and how to reach you on the trip.  
○ Conduct in-country orientation for conduct and 
cultural expectations. Set expectations regarding social 
media. This is especially critical during an emergency. 
○ Conduct safety orientations for service learning 
projects where teams work to construct, alter, and/or 
repair structures, including painting and decorating 
and for agricultural projects; chaperones, with support 
of program providers, must conduct a safety 
orientation at the beginning of each activity.  
● Student Debriefs/Reflections:  
○ Conduct morning briefings to review the day’s itinerary 
and key information. Ask and answer questions.  
○ Conduct afternoon and/or evening debriefings to 
review the next day’s itinerary, gather feedback, 
process the day’s learning, and make any necessary 
adjustments. Engage students in conversations that 
help them process their experiences. Help them to 
reflect and break down stereotypes so that when they 
return, they have a deeper understanding of the 
culture and country they visited. Draw connections to 
how they will take the experience home with them, 
and how the lessons they have learned will translate 
back home.  


Page 30:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 30 of 104 
● Check-Ins and Student Supervision: 
○ Conduct frequent check-ins with the chaperone team 
to assess programming, student dynamics, and to 
make any adjustments.  
○ Conduct frequent check-Ins with students about their 
behavioral and physical health as well as their ability to 
process their trip experiences.  
○ Conduct nightly bed checks to ensure students are in 
their rooms at the designated time. If staying in a 
hotel/hostel, be sure to request in advance for students 
to be placed near chaperones. If students are with host 
families, share the BPS policy of nightly bed checks to 
ensure students are safely in their rooms each night. 
Students should know exactly how to get in touch with 
a chaperone in case of an emergency (room number or 
phone number if staying with a host family).  
○ Establish a curfew with clear guidelines, and ensure 
doors are open if students congregate in the evening. 
Adults should stay close by and conduct frequent 
expected and unexpected room checks. Be mindful 
about romantic relationships among students. 
○ Do not leave students alone! Students should be 
accompanied by chaperones (or if applicable, host 
families and students) unless part of a scheduled 
activity and age appropriate, as approved by their 
parent/guardian in advance. However, if 
unaccompanied as part of a scheduled and structured 
activity, students should be in at least groups of three, 
AND always know how to reach an adult chaperone. 
○ Conduct regular, frequent headcounts and buddy 
checks throughout the day.

FIRE PREVENTION AND SAFETY PRACTICES 
International & Overnight Programs 
Fire safety plans on overnight and international programs differ 
from the procedures set for our schools. The laws that regulate 
fire prevention may differ from what exists in Massachusetts. The 
steps below must be followed on all overnight and international 
programs:  
1. Conduct A Fire Prevention Assessment  
The program leader must conduct a fire safety prevention 
assessment using the Fire Prevention and Safety Form 
(Attachment A) within 24 hours of arrival. Using the Fire 
Prevention and Safety Form, the program leader shall formulate 
a plan for the evacuation of all persons on the trip in the event of 
a fire or other emergency. This plan shall include alternate means 
of egress and should be created in consultation with an 
accommodation staff person, and if applicable, the third-party 
provider.  
 
2. Prepare Chaperone Team on Fire Prevention Strategy  
Based on the results from the Fire Prevention and Safety Form, 
the program leader should ensure that each staff member 
receives and understands the fire prevention landscape and has 


Page 86:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 86 of 104 
instructions on the fire drill procedure created for the 
accommodation. Questions to review include: 
A. What are the best means of egress in case of a fire? 
(Consider all rooms students and staff are staying in 
and all places where the group may congregate. Use 
the hotel’s posted evacuation routes if applicable.) 
B. Where is the designated meeting point? (This meeting 
point should be a safe distance from the building, but 
easy for the group to identify and locate.) 
C. Who is responsible for each student? (Attendance 
must be taken; if chaperone ratios permit, the lead 
chaperone should not be assigned to a group and 
should serve as contact person for emergency 
personnel.) 
D. What are some hazards that students and chaperones 
should be aware of? 
E. What happens in the case of a missing person?  
3. Review Prevention Strategy with Students and Conduct a 
Fire Drill 
The lead chaperone and the chaperone team will review the fire 
prevention strategy and conduct a fire drill (walkthrough) with 
the students within the first 24 hours of the trip. Conducting a 
fire drill (walkthrough) is important as participants are unfamiliar 
with the building. 
 
 


Page 87:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 87 of 104 
Instructions For Fire Drills 
Since each accommodation is different, each plan and drill will 
vary. Regardless of the accommodation, it is critical that a 
procedure is in place for evacuating the building, each chaperone 
knows their responsibilities, every student participates in the fire 
drill (walkthrough), and each person knows the meeting location 
when evacuated from the building. Please note: A fire drill as 
defined here is a walkthrough of the route the group will take to 
exit the premises in the event of an emergency. 
A few general instructions:  
• Evacuate immediately. 
• Do not use elevators during a fire evacuation. 
• Each student should walk to the designated meeting 
location outside of the building in a quiet and orderly 
manner. 
• Make sure all students know all possible exits from their 
area and that students know where the meeting location is 
outside of the building. 
• Fire drill plans must ensure adequate procedures for the 
emergency evacuation of students and staff with disabilities. 
(Have a staging location for students/staff with disabilities 
and make sure hotel/hostel personnel are also aware.)  
• Chaperones are responsible for students under their 
supervision and must take attendance. 
• Upon the evacuation of a building, no person or persons 
shall re-enter the building without the authorization of the 
lead chaperone. The lead chaperone, as a part of their fire 


Page 88:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 88 of 104 
drill procedures, must establish a command procedure for 
such evacuations. 
4. Conduct a Post-Fire Drill Debrief 
After the fire drill, the chaperone team should set aside time to 
debrief. Record response on Attachment A.

consequences include, but are not limited to, being sent

PARENT/GUARDIANS/ STUDENTS AGE 18 OR OLDER:  
I fully understand the following conditions regarding student 
international travel with BPS:  
● The BPS Code of Conduct applies on all field trips. Following 
an investigation, if the program leader, in consult with the 
principal/head of school and central office staff, determines 
that a student’s conduct, while on an overnight trip, poses a 
risk to themselves or the safety of the group, or is no longer 
manageable by BPS staff in the field, the district reserves 
the right to request and arrange for that student to return 
home. The district also reserves the right to request that 
families assume responsibility for all or a portion of the 
costs associated with their child’s return. Students may be 
subject to further disciplinary action and will be provided 
the opportunity to have a formal hearing at the school level 
upon return.  
● If a student is to be dismissed from an 
international/overnight field trip due to behavior that 
violates the BPS Code of Conduct while participating in a 
domestic overnight or international trip, the student’s 
parent/guardian must be notified in advance and should 
agree to meet the student at the airport or other agreed 
upon destination. If the parent/guardian is not reachable, 
the student’s principal or appropriate school-based point of 
contact must be notified and agree to meet the student at 


Page 97:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 97 of 104 
the airport, or other agreed upon destination. Students 
under the age of 16 must be accompanied on their flight by 
a chaperone. Students over the age of 16 may fly 
unaccompanied, though a chaperone must accompany the 
student to the airport to ensure the student checks in for 
their flight. (Age requirements may be subject to specific 
airline/train/bus guidelines). Any costs assumed in this 
regard will be the responsibility of the parent/guardian.  
● Parents or students who sign contracts, and or agreements 
with third party company vendors, acknowledge that 
outside companies protocols and procedures might differ 
from BPS policies and procedures. Families should 
especially be aware of cancellation and refund policies. BPS 
is not responsible for money paid to third party vendors.  
● BPS reserves the right to cancel a trip at any time. Trip 
destinations that impose an immediate risk to our students 
will be canceled. In these instances all families will be 
notified immediately.

SAFETY & RESPONSIBILITY 
I understand that my safety, and the safety of other participants 
is extremely important during this field trip, and I agree to make 
safety my first priority. I agree to conduct myself in a manner that 
promotes my safety, and the safety of others at all times. I 
understand that maintaining students’ safety requires that 
students must be supervised by me and/or other chaperones at 
all times while students are engaged in field trip activities. For 
overnight and international field trips, I understand that 
nighttime curfews, and room checks for students, as well as

Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 100 of 104 
agree to follow BPS policies, protocols, and guidance of BPS staff 
when in the field.  
DRUG & ALCOHOL POLICY  
I understand that the BPS Code of Conduct prohibits students 
from possessing, using, selling and/or distributing any of the 
following on all domestic and international field trips: 
Alcohol; marijuana, non-prescribed controlled substances, 
imitation controlled substances, inhalants, other intoxicants, 
controlled or drug paraphernalia; unauthorized possession, use or 
distribution of over the counter medication, and selling of 
prescription drugs. The Code also prohibits the use of tobacco 
products (including e-cigarettes, hookah paraphernalia, and 
vapor cigarettes). I understand that these prohibitions apply to all 
students, regardless of age.  
I understand that I am forbidden to use or visibly be in possession 
of tobacco in the presence of students. I also understand that the 
use of all other drugs, including alcohol, and weapons are strictly 
prohibited on the field trip.

Attachment: Nurse Verification Form 
OVERVIEW & INSTRUCTIONS 
This is a mandatory risk management procedure. Please 
complete this form at least 10 weeks prior to departure.  
It is BPS’ goal that you are in the strongest position to support 
each student’s health while abroad. Program leaders must review 
all students’ medical forms and consult with the school nurse to 
ensure all documents are accurately completed.   
Please note: the school nurse does not “clear” students for travel 
but will provide trip leaders/chaperones with guidance in 
supporting students medically while traveling. Program leaders 
shall consult with, and when necessary, receive training from and 
obtain written comments from the school nurse regarding any 
students who have expressed medical needs (e.g., medication, 
asthma, allergies, etc.).  
It is important for program leaders and chaperones to know that 
many students and families omit medical information from 
permission slips for a variety of reasons, and in some cases 
Program leaders discover medical conditions that the nurse was 
not aware of. Therefore, it becomes a collective duty to ensure 
that we have the most up to date medical information for all 
student travelers. Program leaders should actively discuss the 
importance of honesty and full medical disclosure with students 
and families at one of the pre-departure meetings.  
School nurses can assist with the following (list is not limited to 
what is below): 


Page 102:
 
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-25 
Page 102 of 104 
● A student's current medical status/current immunization 
record  
● Background information regarding a particular medical 
condition 
● Specific medication instructions and training for 
medication application if necessary  
● Epi Pen instructions  
● Can help determine appropriate trip accommodations and 
considerations for the student traveler  
● Can further consult with outside medical professionals who 
are involved with the student’s medical needs. i.e. social 
workers, occupational therapist and the child’s primary care 
physician.  
Program leaders must provide the nurse with the following 
information and a student traveler roster: Trip destination, dates, 
and draft itinerary. The Nurse Verification Form to follow must 
be submitted 10 weeks prior to departure. It may be mailed or 
scanned to DGE. For additional questions please contact Kayla 
Dorsey-Twumasi, Director of Global Educcation.
