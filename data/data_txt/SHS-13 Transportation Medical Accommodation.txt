Circular 
NUMBER: 
SHS-13 
Version 01 
 
 
 
TRANSPORTATION, MEDICAL ACCOMMODATION  
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded by a 
subsequent version 
 
Some students may be eligible for transportation 
accommodation based on medical needs. The following 
guidelines and processes refer to transportation for student 
medical indications only. Transportation accommodations for 
medical needs do not include transportation accommodations 
written into an Individualized Education Program (IEP). 
BACKGROUND 
Medical transportation is warranted when a student’s illness, 
managed by a health care professional, requires the assistance of 
transportation as an accommodation to enable the student to 
attend school. Transportation accommodations for medical 
needs should not substitute for treatment of specific medical 
conditions. The school, through the Student Support Team, is 
encouraged to explore creative solutions to assist these families 
with extraordinary needs. Children with chronic medical 
conditions that cannot be remediated by medication or therapy 
may be granted renewal each year. Renewal is collaboratively 
determined by the school nurse and central office staff. Schools 
will be notified in the spring to begin the transportation renewal 
process. No student should be considered “renewed” until

receiving written notification that will be sent according to the 
Transportation Office policy.  
POLICY IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES 
Parent/Guardian Role: 
• Inform the school nurse of medical diagnosis and provide 
supporting medical documentation that may require 
transportation as an accommodation. 
• Communicate with the school nurse and their child’s health 
care provider regarding the need for medical transportation. 
• All participants in the process may seek further assistance 
by contacting Health Services at 617-635-6788 or the 
Department of Transportation at 617-635-9520. 
School Principal/Head of School Role: 
• Review, discuss, and approve each case with the Student 
Support Team and/or school nurse. 
• Designate a member of the Student Support Team to 
collaborate with the school nurse to inform 
parents/guardians of eligibility determination. 
• All participants in the process may seek further assistance 
by contacting Health Services at 617-635-6788 or the 
Department of Transportation at 617-635-9520. 
School Nurse Role: 
• Provide parents/guardians with a release of medical 
information form to be signed to obtain consent to speak 
with the student’s licensed health care provider. 


Page 3:

• Contact the licensed healthcare provider to inform them of 
the BPS transportation accommodation policy, discuss the 
request submitted by the parent/guardian, and share 
clinical observations related to the child’s medical condition.  
• Present the case to the Student Support Team, including 
notes taken during discussions with the parent/guardian 
and licensed health care provider to determine the 
appropriate accommodations, if any. 
• Document all relevant and objective information related to 
transportation in the student’s electronic health record. 
• If the school nurse does not believe transportation is 
warranted based on the above criteria, but any other 
participant in the process disagrees, the case is referred to 
School Health Services for further clarification and 
resolution. 
Student Support Team Role: 
• Discuss medical transportation request cases as referred by 
the school nurse. 
• Each request should be considered individually, and other 
options must be reviewed prior to authorization of medical 
transportation. If additional support is needed, the Student 
Support Team may make referrals for 504 or special 
education concerns. 
• All participants in the process may seek further assistance 
by contacting Health Services at 617-635-6788 or the 
Department of Transportation at 617-635-9520.

Coordinator of Special Education (COSE) Role: 
• If a student is eligible for a 504 accommodation plan (or is 
being evaluated for a 504 accommodation plan), the team 
shall discuss eligibility for transportation. 
• If a student already has an IEP (or is being evaluated) and 
transportation may be necessary for the medical condition 
(but not necessarily the area of educational disability), the 
team shall consider transportation needs. As part of this 
consideration, the team shall include the school nurse. If 
special transportation is found to be necessary for the 
student to benefit from special education services and make 
meaningful educational progress, it can be added to the IEP. 
• If a student is referred for consideration for a 504 
accommodation plan and/or special education and related 
services, the COSE will process the request for 
transportation as appropriate. 
• All participants in the process may seek further assistance 
by contacting Health Services at 617-635-6788 or the 
Department of Transportation at 617-635-9520. 
School Health Services Role: 
• A member of the Health Services administrative team will 
be available to discuss any request for transportation as an 
accommodation for medical needs.  
• School Health Services will consult with any party involved 
in the transportation as an accommodation for the medical 
needs process regarding the eligibility determination. 
• In some cases, School Health Services may overturn the

initial determination or provide recommendations for 
alternative accommodations to support the student’s needs. 
Department of Transportation Role: 
• After approval, the parent/guardian of the student will be 
notified by mail of transportation specifics (time of pick-
up/drop-off/bus numbers/effective date). School staff may 
access route information via Aspen. 
• Collaborate with School Health Services regarding the 
medical transportation renewal process. 
• Transportation requests for students who are healthy, but 
whose parents or guardians are ill, will not be approved.  
 
ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION 
A student determined to be eligible: 
• The school nurse will fill out the Request for Medical 
Transportation form provided below and submit it to 
school-based leadership for final approval; the signed form 
will be sent via email to the school’s Transportation Officer 
within the Department of Transportation by the school 
leader and/or school transportation coordinator. 
• Once approved, the parent/guardian of the student will be 
notified by mail of transportation specifics (time of pick-
up/drop-off/bus numbers/effective date). School staff may 
access route information via Aspen.

A student determined NOT eligible: 
• The parent/guardian will be notified by the principal 
designee in collaboration with the school nurse. 
• All participants in the process may seek further assistance 
by contacting Health Services at 617-635-6788 or the 
Department of Transportation at 617-635-9520. 
 
SPECIFIC GUIDELINES 
Asthma: Transportation as an accommodation for asthma is 
reserved for severe asthmatics that are adhering to a treatment 
plan, have a rescue inhaler at school, and have an Asthma Action 
Plan on file with the school nurse. If asthma impacts a student’s 
ability to walk to a school bus or MBTA stop, further medical 
evaluation and treatment may be necessary and should be 
discussed with the child’s health care provider. Even the most 
compliant students with asthma may need medical 
transportation during the cold winter months. Mild, episodic 
asthmatic students on intermittent medications do not qualify 
for medical transportation. 
Sickle Cell: Please refer to Superintendent’s Circular SHS-25. 
Ambulation: Students with conditions that significantly affect 
ambulation, such as leg braces, crutches, lower extremity 
fractures, or amputations may be eligible for transportation as an 
accommodation. Students who can ambulate and fully 
participate in the school program should not be authorized for 
medical transportation.  
Seizure Disorder: Students experiencing current, intermittent 


Page 7:
Superintendent’s Circular SHS-13 
Page 7 of 11 
 
 
 
seizure activity are eligible for transportation accommodation 
until stabilized. In general, if seizures are well controlled, medical 
transportation will not be provided. 
Emotional/Behavioral Problems:  Children with emotional and/or 
behavioral issues which impact their transportation to or from 
school should be discussed at the Student Support Team 
meeting before any referral is made for this type of 
transportation accommodation. ADHD, depression/anxiety, 
impulsivity, and other behavioral issues have an impact on 
teaching and learning as well as school access. Behavioral 
modification and other modalities may be more beneficial to the 
child’s overall functioning than just transportation alone. The 
school nurse will gather the medically relevant information for 
the team. 
Other: Neuromuscular disorders, cardiac disease, and other 
medical conditions should be reviewed on an individual basis; 
consult with School Health Services as needed.
