grade, the student must also present documentation to their 
assigned school within 30 days of reporting. If the school 
recommends a change in the student’s grade placement, the school

processing by Welcome Services. 
Grade-age assignment in the Boston Public Schools is structured to 
provide a supportive environment in which each student is able to 
grow both academically and socially.  BPS understands students may 
learn differently and need appropriate adjustments to their 
curriculum to ensure they are learning at a pace that fosters success.  
Therefore, teachers are trained to adjust

within their classrooms.

their age.  Students should be aware that schools may shift their 
grade level upon enrollment in their assigned school after a 
transcript review with their school counselor. 
Students with disabilities will be placed in accordance with the grade 
level indicated by their IEP. 
If the student has not recently attended school in the U.S., a U.S.

GRADE LEVEL ADVANCEMENT OR REGRESSION 
If a family/emancipated student is contesting their grade level 
placement due to the grade-age assignment process followed while 
in a Welcome Center or the Newcomers Assessment & Counseling 
Center (NACC), the student must be assessed by the school.  If the 
school recommends a change in the student’s grade placement, the 
school leader must submit a “Grade Level Change” request form to 
their school superintendent or operational leader for approval and 
processing by Welcome Services within 30 days of student reporting 
to school. 
If after a period of at least one academic term/semester, a school 
team1 determines that a particular student may benefit from a grade 
level change due to exceptional advancement or regression based 
on other conditions not present during the registration period, a 
school leader may request a grade level change by completing the 
“Grade Level Change” request form and submitting to their school 
superintendent or operational leader for approval and processing by 
Welcome Services.  All changes must be completed by the end of the 
first marking period. 
 
 
1 School-based teams must be composed of content teachers, 
English Learner, and Special Education faculty based on the 
student’s instructional program.
