Circular 
NUMBER: 
LGL-07 
Version 01 
 
PRIVACY OF STUDENT INFORMATION AND STUDENT 
RECORD PROCEDURES: HOW TO RESPOND TO 
STUDENT RECORD REQUESTS IN COMPLIANCE WITH 
FERPA AND STATE LAW 
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded by a 
subsequent version 
I. 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
These student record procedures pertain to all information 
maintained by the Boston Public Schools concerning a student in 
which he/she may be individually identified.  
The student record consists of two parts: the transcript and the 
temporary record. 
A. 
The transcript contains administrative records that 
constitute the minimum data necessary to reflect the 
student's educational progress and to operate the 
educational system. The transcript is limited to the 
name, address, and phone number of the student, the 
student’s birth date, name, address and phone number 
of the custodial parent or guardian, course titles, 
grades (or the equivalent when grades are not 
applicable), course credit, grade level completed, and 
the year completed. The transcript must be retained for 
at least sixty (60) years after the student leaves the 
school system. 


Page 2:
Superintendent’s Circular LGL-07 
Page 2 of 21 
 
B. 
The temporary record is all other student record 
information besides the transcript.  Temporary record 
information may include health information, 
disciplinary information, examples of student work, 
special education or 504 plan documents, incident 
reports, and any other information kept by the school 
which identifies the student individually. Duplicates of 
an original record do not need to be kept as part of the 
temporary record. The temporary record should be 
destroyed no later than seven (7) years after the 
student leaves the school system, provided proper 
notification is given as directed below. 
II. 
PARENTS (AND STUDENTS) HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT TO 
CONTROL ACCESS TO STUDENT INFORMATION 
Both federal and state law provide that a parent, and any student 
that is 14 or older and/or in grade nine or above, have a legal right 
to control access to the student’s educational record. The Family 
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and Massachusetts 
law define the parent’s/student’s right to access, seek to amend 
and exercise control over the disclosure of personally identifiable 
information in the student record. The Boston Public Schools is 
legally responsible to respect and protect the parent’s/student’s 
rights to privacy and control under FERPA and state law. 
Violation of these legal rights can subject BPS to sanctions, 
including termination of federal funding, and can subject BPS 
employees to discipline, up to and including termination. 
BPS notifies all students and parents of these rights annually by 
means of the “Guide to BPS for Students & Families.” The Guide 
for Students & Families identifies the limited types of information 
that may be released without consent (see Directory Information 
below). By September 30 of each year, parents and students have 


Page 3:
Superintendent’s Circular LGL-07 
Page 3 of 21 
 
a right to inform the school that such information shall not be 
released without direct consent. 
Schools receive requests for student record information in many 
ways and from many different sources.  By law, a school’s 
response to a request for student records must vary depending 
on who is making the request and what is being requested. 
Below are descriptions of the main categories of requests that 
schools may need to address. If the information below does not 
directly describe a situation presented, the school should contact 
the Office of Legal Advisor at legal@bostonpublicschools.org for 
more direction.  
III. 
REQUESTS AND CONSENT BY PARENT/STUDENT  
When a parent or student seeks to access, amend or consent to 
sharing of student records, the following definitions will aid you 
in understanding and complying with applicable law. 
• A parent is the student’s natural parent, a guardian, or an 
individual acting as a parent in the absence of a parent or 
guardian. 
• A custodial parent is any parent with whom a child 
resides, whether permanently or for periods of time, and 
who supervises the child. 
• A non-custodial parent is any parent who does not have 
physical custody of the child and who does not reside 
with or supervise the child, even for short periods of time, 
by court order.  
• An eligible student is a student who is at least 14 years of 
age and/or has entered the ninth grade.

Superintendent’s Circular LGL-07 
Page 4 of 21 
 
A. Request to Inspect/Copy Records 
1. Custodial Parents and Eligible Student. A custodial 
parent, and/or an eligible student have a right to 
inspect all portions of the student record upon 
request.  The record will be made available to the 
custodial parent and/or eligible student no later 
than ten (10) days after the request.  The custodial 
parent and/or eligible student have the right to 
receive copies of any part of the record.  In addition, 
the custodial parent and/or eligible student may 
request to have parts of the record interpreted by a 
qualified professional of the school or may invite 
anyone else of their choosing to inspect or interpret 
the record with them.  Please see Attachment 1 for 
the process of fulfilling a custodial parent’s or 
eligible student’s request for the student record. 
2. Non-Custodial Parents. Non-custodial parents must 
be given access to their children’s student records, 
unless the school has been given written 
documentation that establishes either:  
a. The non-custodial parent has been denied legal 
custody by a court based upon a threat to the 
student or to the custodial parent. 
b. The non-custodial parent has been denied 
visitation or has supervised visitation.  
c. Access to the student or to the custodial parent 
has been restricted by a court-issued protective 
order against the non-custodial parent, 
provided such protective order does not 
specifically allow access to student record 
information. 


Page 5:
Superintendent’s Circular LGL-07 
Page 5 of 21 
 
d. There is an order of a probate and family court 
judge which prohibits distribution of student 
records to the non-custodial parent.   
A school that receives a request for student record 
information from a non-custodial parent should send 
a copy of the notification attached as Attachment 2, 
via certified and first-class mail, to the custodial 
parent prior to providing student records to the non-
custodial parent.  The notification must be in English 
and the primary language of the custodial parent.  If 
no documentation related to any of the four (4) 
scenarios above is received within 21 days, the records 
must be provided to the non-custodial parent. If 
documentation related to any of the four (4) scenarios 
above is received within 21 days, it must be kept in the 
student record and the non-custodial parent must be 
notified, via certified and first class mail, of the reason 
for denial of access.  
B. Request to Amend Student Record 
The custodial parent and/or eligible student have the 
right to add relevant comments, information, or other 
written materials to the student record.  In addition, the 
custodial parent and/or eligible student have the right to 
make a written request that information in the record be 
amended or deleted, except information created by a 
special education team, which may not be amended or 
deleted until after acceptance of the individualized 
education plan or completion of the appeals process.  
The custodial parent and/or eligible student have a right 
to a conference with the school principal to make their 
objections known.  Within one week after the 


Page 6:
Superintendent’s Circular LGL-07 
Page 6 of 21 
 
conference, the principal must render a decision in 
writing.  If the custodial parent and/or eligible student 
are not satisfied with the decision, it may be appealed to 
the operational leader. 
C. Consent to Share Student Information 
The custodial parent and/or eligible student have the 
legal right to consent to sharing of the student record 
with any person or entity they choose. A school should 
use Attachment 4 to document the custodial parent’s 
and/or eligible student’s specific, informed, written 
consent and include the signed consent in the student 
record. 
Except as specifically noted below, no individuals or 
organizations other than the custodial parent, eligible 
student, and authorized school personnel are allowed to 
have access to information in the student record without 
the specific, informed, written consent of the custodial 
parent or the eligible student.   
IV. 
THIRD PARTY REQUESTS FOR STUDENT-IDENTIFYING 
INFORMATION: CONSENT NOT REQUIRED OR ASSUMED BY 
OPERATION OF LAW 
A. 
Subpoenaed Records. Boston Public Schools will 
produce documents requested in court orders or 
lawfully issued subpoenas. Such requests should be 
emailed immediately to the Office of Legal Advisor.  All 
records sought by the court order or subpoena should 
be forwarded via courier mail or hand delivery as soon 
as possible.  Attachment 3 should be completed and 
used to notify the parent and/or eligible student that 
subpoenaed information will be provided absent 


Page 7:
Superintendent’s Circular LGL-07 
Page 7 of 21 
 
further court order. 
B. 
Authorized School Personnel.  Authorized school 
personnel (those providing direct services to the 
student, administrative staff whose duties require 
them to access the student record, and an evaluation 
team that evaluates a student) shall have access to the 
student’s school record when such access is required in 
the performance of their official duties. 
C. 
Directory Information.  Unless the parent or eligible 
student has previously indicated in writing their 
disapproval of the release of such information, the 
school may release the following directory information: 
student’s name, age, grade level, and dates of 
enrollment.  BPS notifies students and parents 
annually of the types of information that will be 
released by means of the “Guide to BPS for Students & 
Families,” and allows custodial parents and students 
until September 30 of each year to inform BPS that 
such information will not be released without prior 
consent. 
D. 
Military Recruiters and Higher Education Institutions.  
Unless a parent or student has previously objected in 
writing in response to notification through the 
publication of the “Guide to BPS for Students & 
Families,” military recruiters and institutions of higher 
education must be provided, upon written request, 
with the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
secondary school students. All requests by military 
recruiters for such information must be forwarded to 
the Office of Legal Advisor for centralized processing.  
E. 
Specified State Agencies and Local Authorities. A 


Page 8:
Superintendent’s Circular LGL-07 
Page 8 of 21 
 
school may release student record information without 
prior written consent to the following agencies when 
acting in their official capacities: Department of 
Children and Families, Department of Youth Services, a 
probation officer, or a justice of the court.  Attachment 
3 should be used to notify parents of such requests. 
F. 
Schools. When a student seeks or intends to transfer to 
another school, the student record can be sent to the 
receiving school. 
G. 
School Nurses and State Health Department.  School 
nurses and local and state health department officials 
may have access to student health record information 
when such access is required in the performance of 
their official duties.  For further information related to 
student health information, please consult 
Superintendent’s Circular LGL-16, Student Health 
Information. 
H. 
Health or Safety Emergency.  Without the consent of 
the parent or eligible student, a school may disclose 
information regarding a student to appropriate parties 
in connection with a health or safety emergency if 
knowledge of the information is necessary to protect 
the health or safety of the student or individuals and if 
the appropriate procedure has been followed.  That 
does not mean that anyone who asks, and who thinks 
something is amiss or might happen, has a right to 
access personally identifiable student information.   
Required criteria: The regulations implementing 
FERPA (34 CFR § 99.36) requires that each of the 
following criteria be met: 
a. 
The request is made “in connection with an 


Page 9:
Superintendent’s Circular LGL-07 
Page 9 of 21 
 
emergency.” 
i. “Emergency” means the request must be 
related to an actual, impending, or imminent 
emergency.  
ii. BPS requires that a school consider the 
following criteria to determine whether the 
request is made in connection with an 
emergency: 
• The seriousness of the threat to the health 
or safety of the student or others 
• The need for the information to meet the 
threat 
• Whether the requestor is able to deal with 
the emergency 
• The extent to which time is of the essence 
in dealing with the emergency. 
iii. Any release of records is limited to the period 
of the emergency; if the emergency is over no 
further release of student information is 
allowed. 
b. 
There is an articulable and significant threat to 
the health or safety of the student or other 
individuals. 
c. 
The requester (usually law enforcement, public 
health officials, and medical professionals) needs 
the information to protect the health or safety of 
the student or other individuals. 
d. 
No blanket release of personally identifiable 
information is allowed. Any release of 


Page 10:
Superintendent’s Circular LGL-07 
Page 10 of 21 
 
information must be narrowly tailored 
considering the immediacy, magnitude, and 
specificity of the threat.   
e. 
The determination is made on a case-by-case 
basis, considering the totality of the 
circumstances pertaining to the threat to the 
health or safety of the student or others.   
f. 
Within a reasonable time after making the 
disclosure, the school must record in the 
student’s record the articulable and significant 
threat that formed the basis for the disclosure, 
and to whom the information was disclosed. 
V. 
THIRD PARTY REQUESTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS 
CONTAINING ONLY REDACTED AND/OR NON-STUDENT-
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION 
Upon receipt of a third-party request for public records, the 
school should immediately send a copy of the request via 
email to the Office of Legal Advisor for review and direction.  
All public records requests must be reduced to writing, 
dated, and signed by the requestor, and must contain the 
return address information of the requestor. For more 
information, see Superintendent’s Circular LGL-3, Public 
Records Requests. 
VI. 
DESTRUCTION OF STUDENT RECORDS 
The law sets forth different time periods for the retention 
and destruction of different portions of student records.  
These different time periods are set forth below: 
A. Transcripts - A student’s transcript must be maintained 
by the school department for sixty (60) years following 


Page 11:
Superintendent’s Circular LGL-07 
Page 11 of 21 
 
the student’s graduation, transfer, or withdrawal from 
the school system. 
B. Periodic Review of the Temporary Record - While a 
student is enrolled in a school, the principal/head of 
school or his/her designee shall periodically review all 
students’ temporary records and identify for destruction 
any misleading, outdated, or irrelevant information.  This 
may include, particularly, exemplars of student work or 
other impertinent information.  Prior to destroying any 
such information, however, the student and his/her 
parent must be given written notification of the school’s 
intent to destroy such information and must be given the 
opportunity to receive the information or a copy of the 
information prior to its destruction. 
C. Temporary Record Destruction - The temporary record 
of any student may be destroyed no later than seven (7) 
years after the student transfers, graduates or withdraws 
from the school district, if the student and his/her 
parent/guardian have been given written notification 
that includes the approximate date of destruction of the 
temporary record and indicating their right to receive the 
information in whole or in part at the time of the 
student’s graduation, transfer or withdrawal from the 
school system or prior to its destruction.  Such notice 
must be in addition to the annual notice issued by 
Boston Public Schools in the “Guide to BPS For Students 
& Families.”

ATTACHMENT 1 
STUDENT RECORD REQUEST PROCEDURES 
1. Parent/guardian or eligible student requests for the student’s 
record are received, processed, and sent to the requestor 
directly by the school. Third-party requests are received by the 
Office of Legal Advisor, processed by the school, and then sent 
back to the Office of Legal Advisor for transmission to the 
requester. 
2. The principal/head of school will be responsible for certifying 
that all portions of the student record have been copied as a 
response to the requestor. The principal/head of school will 
complete the checklist and certification. If the request is being 
sent to the parent, the certification will include the date sent to 
the parent. A copy of the checklist will be sent with the record, 
and the original will be retained by the school.  
3. For third party requests, the principal/head of school will 
complete the same process but provide the copy of the entire 
record and the checklist to the Office of Legal Advisor for 
review and delivery. 
4. Requests received during the summer months:  By June 1 of 
each year, principals must identify who to contact for each 
week of the summer break and provide that list to the school 
superintendent. The designated individual will check for 
incoming mail and for parent/guardian or eligible student 
requests, will obtain the records (copy and/or print), complete 
the checklist, and deliver them to the requester.  In the event 
of a third-party request, the same protocol will be followed but 
the designated individual will send the record and the 
completed checklist to the Office of Legal Advisor.
