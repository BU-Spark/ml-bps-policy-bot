Superintendent’s 
Circular 
NUMBER: 
ODA-07 
Version 01 
 
 
 
REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION TO WITHDRAW 
STUDENTS 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
This circular lists the documentation schools are required to 
obtain when withdrawing students and includes information on 
monitoring processes conducted by the central office.  
For the last several years, Boston Public Schools has been under a 
state audit regarding our documentation of student withdrawals. 
Auditors found that we collect insufficient documentation of 
students categorized as withdrawals. The audit finding has been 
upgraded to a “material weakness,” which is a more severe 
finding. Lack of action could result in loss of federal funds (e.g., 
Title 1) and/or the City’s overall credit rating. The Systemic 
Improvement Plan required the district to revise withdrawal 
procedures and implement controls for monitoring. All 
administrative school staff (school leaders, registrars, or any 
school administrator whose responsibilities involve enrolling or 
withdrawing students) are required to complete asynchronous 
training at the 2024 Management and Operations Institute. 
OVERVIEW OF REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION 
This section seeks to clarify what documentation is required and 
acceptable. Schools can use this template to document

interactions with families and upload along with supporting 
documentation or with a family signature. Your school may use 
your own template as long as it contains the necessary 
information and has been approved by the central office (contact: 
student-withdrawal@bostonpublicschools.org). 
ACCEPTABLE DOCUMENTATION TYPES FOR STUDENTS 
WITHDRAWING INCLUDES: 
1. A written request for a student’s records from a receiving 
public or private high school or an educational program 
(that culminates in a regular high school diploma). This 
includes requests from the receiving school that come to 
the district through Scrib Order. 
2. Written record of a response from an official receiving 
school or program acknowledging the student’s enrollment. 
3. Written confirmation from a parent or guardian that their 
student has moved to another state or country and will be 
continuing their education. 
4. Written confirmation from a parent/guardian updating the 
school enrollment status of their child, including indication 
that they will be continuing their education elsewhere. 
5. Letter from the BPS Office of Expanded Learning Time, 
indicating an approved Educational Plan for homeschooling. 
6. Record from the state's data system (Edwin DESE Security 
Portal - Central Office Process)

If you do not have the above documentation at the time of 
withdrawal, the student must be withdrawn as a dropout. See 
Appendix for a table of withdrawal codes with acceptable 
matching documentation. 
REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF SUFFICIENT WITHDRAWAL 
DOCUMENTATION FOR A TRANSFER STUDENT INCLUDE: 
1. Date when the transfer occurred or was confirmed, 
including the year. 
2. Identifiable name of the student withdrawing 
3. Identifiable information for who is confirming the 
withdrawal, such as the parent name or receiving school 
registrar’s email address 
4. Indication that the student is continuing their education 
elsewhere 
a. New school name is ideal but not required. Stating a 
student will enroll in a school elsewhere is sufficient if 
the new school name is not known. 
Withdrawal documentation must be uploaded to the student 
record in Aspen at the time of the withdrawal in a non-editable 
format, such as a PDF, screenshot, scanned handwritten & signed 
withdrawal form or letter. Word documents, Aspen journal 
entries, travel tickets or itineraries are not acceptable forms of 
documentation to confirm a transfer. 
MONITORING AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
School leaders will be required to identify a primary point of

contact at their school for withdrawal related processes. 
Additionally, school leaders will be required to sign off that they 
have reviewed student records and that sufficient 
documentation exists for each student’s withdrawal code. This 
sign off will align with the October state reporting period. Central 
office staff will hold office hours and be available to answer 
questions that may arise at this time period and will 
communicate these dates via the Friday Flyer and Weekly Recap.  
Additionally, the central office team will be conducting periodic 
audits to confirm sufficient documentation is in place: Fall, Mid-
Year, End of Year. Supervisors of attendance will be included as a 
resource to support schools in gathering the necessary 
documentation during review periods.
