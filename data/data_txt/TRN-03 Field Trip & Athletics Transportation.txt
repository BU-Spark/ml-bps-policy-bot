 Superintendent’s 
Circular 
NUMBER: 
TRN-03 
Version 01 
 
FIELD TRIP TRANSPORTATION 
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded by a 
subsequent version 
This circular outlines the steps that must be followed when 
transporting students to field trips where BPS transportation or 
an approved outside supplier is used. Additionally, this circular 
outline general rules regarding transporting students in the 
Boston Public Schools with other approved transportation 
suppliers. 
School buses or approved transportation suppliers’ 
vehicles should be used to transport students to and 
from field trips. Privately owned vehicles from non-
approved suppliers or leased vans are not to be 
utilized to transport students to and from field trips, 
except in the case of a genuine emergency. Staff who 
utilize their own vehicles risk being legally liable if 
students are injured while riding in their automobiles. 
 
Transdev is the supplier currently under contract with the Boston 
Public Schools (BPS) to provide transportation services on BPS 
yellow school buses, including field trips. All field trip 
transportation must utilize BPS school buses, unless the request 
cannot be accommodated based on capacity limitations, or an 
approved transportation supplier.

Arrangements with other suppliers are subject to the designation 
of that supplier as approved by Nate Kuder, the Chief Financial 
Officer, and may be made by individual schools/departments 
subject to purchasing regulations.  The approved supplier list can 
be found at the end of this circular. 
Staff should be aware of their responsibility to consult with and 
obtain the approval of their respective school leader or 
department head, using school/BPS letterhead, to make 
agreements or exchange money with parents, outside 
transportation companies, travel agencies, etc.  
When requesting buses for field trips, school leaders should be 
aware that BPS has the greatest bus availability between 9:30 
a.m. and 12:30 p.m. However, we encourage and welcome schools 
to submit all of their field trip requests as outlined in this circular. 
In the event that a request cannot be met, school leaders should 
explore the opportunity to order buses from approved suppliers 
who are not restricted to the use of the BPS school bus fleet. A 
list of approved suppliers is attached at the end of this circular. If 
the Transportation Department is unable to provide service at 
the time requested, Transportation will aim to provide notice to 
the school leader via email at least one week in advance of the 
requested trip date. The Transportation Department does not 
recommend particular suppliers for field trips and does 
recommend the use of our primary supplier, Transdev, whenever 
possible. 
 
All field trips must be budgeted on account 52811, regardless of 
the supplier. If you do not have a field trip account (account 


Page 3:
Superintendent’s Circular TRN-03 
Page 3 of 12 
 
52811), you must submit a budget transfer within your 
organization code to create the appropriate budget line. 
If students in 7th through 12th grade will be utilizing the MBTA 
for a field trip, schools can email schooltrips@mbta.com and/or 
submit a request through the School Field Trip Submission Form 
should they need to acquire MBTA passes for students who do 
not already have a pass because they live within the school’s walk 
zone. 
 
Please refer to the following circulars for guidelines and 
procedures for the planning and implementation of BPS field 
trips: CAO-22 General Guidelines for All Field Trips, CAO-23 Day 
Field Trip Guidelines, CAO-24 Overnight Field Trips Guidelines, 
and CAO-25 International Field Trip Guidelines.
