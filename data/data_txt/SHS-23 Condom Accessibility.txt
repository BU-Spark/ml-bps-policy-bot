Circular 
NUMBER: 
SHS-23 
Version 01 
 
 
 
CONDOM ACCESSIBILITY 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded by a 
subsequent version 
 
BACKGROUND 
In June 2017, the School Committee voted to revise the district 
Wellness Policy, which includes provisions on sexual health 
education and condom accessibility in high schools. The goal of 
this policy is to support the sexual and reproductive health of 
students and to prevent negative sexual health outcomes and 
their impact on student learning. This policy establishes access to 
information and resources for students in order to reduce the 
spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as 
well as decrease the number of unintended pregnancies. This 
policy increases the access and agency of BPS students to care 
for their personal health and well-being. The revised policy states: 
Under Massachusetts Law (Mass.Gen.Laws Ch.111, Section 24E) 
adolescents may seek and consent to confidential family 
planning services without parental notification. Family Planning 
services include testing and treatment for sexually transmitted 
infections and HIV, all birth control options, pregnancy testing, 
and emergency contraception.

BPS High Schools shall provide access to free condoms with 
appropriate reproductive health counseling for students. Each 
high school (grades 9-12) will have a Condom Accessibility Team 
(CAT) which will consist of a minimum of at least three school 
staff members. Condoms will be made available through the 
CAT at each high school. Condoms will also be accessible at 
some schools from school-based health centers and the Boston 
Public Health Commission’s (BPHC) Health Resource Centers 
(HRCs). Parents and caregivers may exempt their students from 
receiving condoms from the BPS CAT by notifying the school 
when they complete the family information forms at the 
beginning of the school year. This condom opt-out does not 
apply to other confidential health services.  
 
Under this policy, the Office of Health Services, along with the 
Office of Health and Wellness, is charged with enacting systems 
and practices to ensure that all students have access to key 
resources and services that are developmentally appropriate and 
support sexual and reproductive health in a safe and supportive 
environment.  
BPS high schools have three possible venues for the delivery of 
sexual health services: 1) through BPS CAT members; 2) school-
based health centers run by BPHC or neighborhood health 
centers that provide medical, reproductive, and mental health 
services, including STI/pregnancy testing, options counseling, 
access to contraceptives/condoms, treatment for STIs, and 
comprehensive routine health care; and 3) school-based health 
resource centers (HRCs) overseen by the Boston Public Health

access, and STI testing and treatment for gonorrhea and 
chlamydia, where available. Annually, all BPS CAT members must 
participate in appropriate training related to the condom 
accessibility program.  
The following chart summarizes the services available and 
staffing model for each location.

services without parental notification. Family planning services include 
testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and HIV, all 
birth control options, pregnancy testing, and emergency 
contraception.
