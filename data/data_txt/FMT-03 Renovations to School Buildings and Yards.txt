The Office of Facilities Management / Planning & Engineering 
must review and approve all plans for improvements to any 
school buildings and yards. 
EXTERNAL FUNDING 
It also strongly recommended that a school communicate with 
the Director of Facilities Management prior to submitting grant 
funding applications, or seeking any other material support that 
may require alterations and/or additions to a schools’ facilities.  
Applicants should first receive acceptance from the director of 
Facilities Management of Facilities Management’s willingness to 
participate in implementation contingent on the school’s 
successful grant application/funding etc.  Principals/heads of 
school, and community school directors must include the 
director of Facilities Management in the drafting of plans that 
would require any form of alteration, addition, repair, and/or 
connections to any building services or location on the property 
of the school. The director of Facilities Management will submit 
the plans, specifications, and/or product data to the appropriate 
Planning and Engineering staff for review and approval of all 
proposed plans, specifications, product data, warranties, and/or 
maintenance agreements. 
This process will ensure that there is a thorough review of the 
proposed renovation, alteration, addition, repair, and/or 
connection to existing building systems, including the materials 
used, quality of workmanship, fairness in pricing, and contractors 
ability to complete the proposed project; and that the contractor 
performing the work has the proper insurance coverage 
(including but not limited to Worker’s Compensation, General 
Liability, and Property Damage).
