NON-IEP COUNSELING GUIDELINES 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded by a 
subsequent version 
INTRODUCTION 
Counseling services are provided to Boston Public School 
students in myriad formats and modalities. Students with and 
without disabilities may receive counseling services within 
Boston Public Schools. Students with disabilities may have IEPs 
that contain counseling as a related service mandating the 
frequency and duration of counseling. Non-disabled students 
without IEPs may be participating in counseling sessions 
formulated as a result of a recommendation of the Student 
Support Team in collaboration with staff from the Behavioral 
Health Services department. As a result of partnerships with 
external agencies, counseling also may be provided to BPS 
students by mental health providers who are not BPS employees.  
With this document, the Boston Public Schools seeks to ensure a 
standard level of practice for the provision of counseling services 
so that consistent practices may be implemented in assisting 
students to overcome school-based issues which may be 
hindering their achievement.  
All mental health providers must conform with the Standards for 
School-based Mental Health Services developed in partnership 
between BPS and members of the Boston School-Based

Behavioral Health Collaborative. These standards can be 
obtained on the Boston Public Schools website at

BACKGROUND  
The American Psychological Association has defined counseling 
as a process to help individuals towards overcoming obstacles to 
their personal growth, wherever these may be encountered and 
towards achieving development of their personal growth.  
Massachusetts Department of Mental Health states further that 
mental health counselors render professional services to 
individuals, families, or groups. They apply principles, methods, 
and theories of counseling and psychotherapeutic techniques to 
define goals and develop a treatment plan of action aimed 
towards the prevention, treatment, and resolution of mental and 
emotional dysfunction.  
The American Counseling Association states that “counselors 
encourage client growth and development in ways that foster 
the client’s interest and welfare; counselors avoid fostering 
dependent counseling relationships. The ACA states further that 
“counselors practice in specialty areas new to them only after 
appropriate education, training, and supervised experience. 
While developing new skills in specialty areas, counselors take 
steps to ensure the competence of their work and to protect 
others from possible harm.”  
Boston Public Schools Counseling Work  
In addition to these standard definitions and professional ethics 
of practice, all BPS and non-BPS providers should understand

and demonstrate that their counseling work should support 
teaching and learning goals and effective teaching practices. 
Ultimately, the goal of counseling is to support success within the 
classroom. 
PRIOR TO COUNSELING  
1. The Student Support Team serves as the hub of student 
services within the school. The Student Support Team 
facilitator should have knowledge of the referral for 
counseling, and the recommendation for counseling should 
emerge from the Student Support Team. When necessary, 
counseling referrals can also be made outside of the SST 
process. 
2. The direct service provider designated to be the counseling 
provider should be clear about (1) the scope of the work 
requested in counseling, (2) the reason for the referral, and 
(3) the expected outcome in counseling. If unclear regarding 
the reason for counseling, a meeting should be scheduled 
between the counselor provider and the referring agent to 
discuss these concerns.  
3. The direct service provider should counsel students 
regarding behaviors that impact teaching and learning, 
academic achievement, and daily school functioning.  
4. Specific issues that are trauma related, i.e., physical and/or 
sexual abuse (onset being past or present), death and dying, 
and behaviors that may need psychiatric intervention and 
may necessitate a 51A Report, should be brought to the 
attention of the principal/head of school or the designated 
administrator and the direct service provider’s supervisor. 
These issues should be referred to the appropriate 


Page 4:
Superintendent’s Circular SPE-14 
Page 4 of 9 
 
 
 
community counseling agency/mental health facility.  
5. Written consent must be obtained from the student, parent, 
or legal guardian before beginning counseling (see attached 
consent form). If a student is receiving counseling through 
an outside provider, but in a BPS building, parent/guardian 
should also sign the agency specific consent form.  
6. The direct service provider must outline goals and objectives 
for the individual student (see attached form). Furthermore, 
it is recommended that the direct service provider 
formulate the goals and objectives with input from the 
parent/legal guardian.  
7. Parents/legal guardians should be informed that pertinent 
information regarding specific students may be discussed at 
the Student Support Team meetings. All ethical professional 
standards of confidentiality will be maintained regarding 
the specific nature of the counseling sessions(s).  
8. All direct service providers should maintain professional, 
proper, safe, and appropriate safeguards for the student(s) 
and themselves.  
COUNSELING PRACTICE  
All direct service providers who are counseling students should:  
● Have a consistent counseling schedule which is 
documented and provided to their principal/head of school, 
supervisor, and the needed personnel in the individual 
schools (i.e., teacher, OSS coordinator, Student Support 
coordinator, guidance counselor, and other school 
administrators). 
 


Page 5:
Superintendent’s Circular SPE-14 
Page 5 of 9 
 
 
 
● Meet in rooms that provide appropriate space and levels of 
confidentiality.  
● Guarantee a measure of safety and protection for the 
student and provider, including consideration of the 
distance between a counselor and student and leaving the 
door ajar at all times.  
● Not engage in any physical contact with the student(s) due 
to the possible risk of psychological harm to the student as a 
result of the physical contact (i.e., cradling, “touch therapy,” 
caressing, massaging, and petting). This requirement of no 
physical contact is due to the possibility of psychological 
and/or physical harm to the student as a result of such 
contact. 
● Document each session held and keep progress notes on 
each student. Provisions should be made for sharing themes 
of concern and critical information with the parent/legal 
guardian.  
● Share specific information that relates to the student’s 
academic progress with appropriate staff.  
● Respond to inquiries from the principal/head of school 
regarding the student’s progress in counseling.  
TERMINATING COUNSELING SERVICES  
When counseling goals and objectives have been reached and/or 
there have been several documented absences and/or instances 
of resistance by the student, as well as several documented 
attempts to provide counseling services, termination of 
counseling services may be appropriate. The direct service 
provider should:  


Page 6:
Superintendent’s Circular SPE-14 
Page 6 of 9 
 
 
 
1. Notify the student’s parent or legal guardian. 
2. Notify (in writing) appropriate school personnel 
(principal/head of school, Student Support coordinator, OSS 
coordinator, supervisor, teacher, or other school 
administrator).  
3. Summarize progress and recommendation and follow-up as 
needed (this could be facilitated during the Student Support 
Team meeting, discussions within small learning 
communities, common planning time, and/or teacher 
parent conferences).  
SUMMARY  
Direct service providers, both BPS and non-BPS staff, are an 
integral component of helping students reach their fullest 
academic achievement. Lack of knowledge or misunderstanding 
of ethical and professional practice standards are not a defense 
against charges of unethical and/or inappropriate practice 
conduct. It is important that these practice standards are 
maintained and adhered to for the safety of students and the 
direct service provider. These practice standards ensure a safe, 
protected, and ethical delivery of service for both students and 
the staff members who serve them. If it is determined that these 
guidelines have not been followed and/or that inappropriate, 
unethical and/or unprofessional conduct has occurred, Boston 
Public Schools will take any such action as is appropriate under 
the circumstances. Such action may range from discipline to 
termination from employment or termination of any contract 
with Boston Public Schools as BPS deems appropriate under the 
circumstances.
