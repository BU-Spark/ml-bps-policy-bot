INITIAL IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF 
MULTILINGUAL LEARNERS 
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
The purpose of this circular is to bring clarity and guidance 
regarding the initial identification and assessment of Multilingual 
Learners (MLs) in BPS. The district is obligated to appropriately 
assess and identify MLs as outlined in several key documents, 
including by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and 
Secondary Education’s Guidance1, the Successor Settlement 
Agreement and META Consent Decree. To meet our obligations 
to our MLs and their families, we must ensure that all BPS 
students are correctly assessed, identified, placed, and receive 
appropriate services.

Learners (MLs) in K2 through grade 12 and provide them with the 
appropriate English Learner services and supports. The initial 
identification and assessment of Multilingual Learners follows the 
requirements outlined in paragraphs 28-31 of the Successor 
Settlement Agreement: 
Successor Settlement Agreement Paragraph 28: 
A student must be referred for an English language proficiency 
assessment when the results of the Home Language Survey 
(HLS) indicate that a language other than English is: 
• The primary language used in the home, regardless of the 
language spoken by the student 
• The language most often spoken by the student, and/or 
• The language that the student first acquired. 
If the parent/guardian answered “yes” to one or more of the 
above questions, the student is required to be assessed using the 
grade-level, state-required language screening assessment. 
Please refer to the MA Department of Elementary and Secondary 
Education Guidance on the Initial Identification of English 
Learners for more information on identifying and evaluating ELs. 
The Successor Agreement obligates the district to ensure that 
English language proficiency (ELP) assessments shall be 
accomplished as soon as possible, but no later than 20 days from 
the student’s enrollment during the school year, or within 20 
days or by the first day of the new school year, whichever comes 
later, if the student enrolls during the summer. During peak 
seasons, January 1 through March 15 and August 1 through 
October 31, ELP assessments shall be accomplished as soon as 
possible, but no later than 25 days. Parents/guardians shall be 


Page 4:

Page 4 of 20 
 
informed in writing of assessment results and student 
assignment options no later than 2 school days after the 
completion of the assessments. The Newcomers Assessment and 
Counseling Center provides written notice of the assessment 
scores and school choice options to the parent/guardian at the 
end of the assessment appointment. 
TABLE 1: The following table delineates the process of 
Multilingual Learner identification at the time of enrollment. It 
highlights the departments’ roles and responsibilities and their 
order in Multilingual Learner identification.

PARENT NOTIFICATION AND COUNSELING 
After scoring the assessment, assessment specialists review all 
available information (e.g., transcripts, IEP, 504 plans) collected 
from the parent/guardian during the intake interview to propose 
a program recommendation.  
Next, testers sit with the parent/guardian to inform them, in the 
language of their preference, of the results of the assessment. 
Testers use all available information collected during the 
language testing appointment to counsel the parent/guardian 
about EL programs and services (e.g., SEI, SLIFE, Dual Language, 
etc.) that are appropriate for their child's proficiency level. After 
counseling the families, testers enter scores into the student's 
case record in Aspen SIS, which generates a list of schools with 
the appropriate programs and services. The parent/guardian 
then ranks schools on their choice list and signs the school 
selection form. The tester enters the parent/guardian’s rank order 
choices into SIS, and the case is forwarded to the Welcome 
Services student assignment team. At the end of the visit, the 
family receives a copy of the documents (e.g. Notification of Initial 
Assessment Form they signed. 
2. REASON TO SUSPECT A STUDENT MAY BE AN ENGLISH 
LEARNER 
Paragraph 28 of the Successor Settlement Agreement requires 
the district to assess enrolling students whose Home Language 
Survey does not indicate a language other than English in the 
case that “there is any other reason to believe the student is not 
proficient in English.”  The district has operationalized this 
requirement as detailed in the tables in section 3.

3. PROCESS TO ASSESS STUDENTS FOR ENGLISH LEARNER 
STATUS WHO HAVE AN HLS OF EEE 
Some students may be suspected of being MLs but may not have 
been identified during enrollment because of an HLS score of 
EEE. The following table outlines the action steps necessary to 
determine if such a student is an ML. 
TABLE 2:  Please see Table 2 for the process to assess students 
who have an HLS of EEE and are suspected of being Multilingual

ASSESSMENT CALENDAR SY 2024 
Every year, school-based designated testers assess approximately 
1,300 K1 students under the training and guidance of NACC. To 
ensure that all K1 students identified as Multilingual Learners 
(MLs) receive the related services and programs in SY 2023-2024, 
we ask schools to carefully review, prepare for, and adhere to the 
assessment calendar below.

assessed. Schools should carefully review 
this list. 
If a school suspects a student should be 
on the list to be assessed because a 
language other than English is spoken in 
the home, the LAT should convene to 
determine if the student is eligible for 
testing. Contact NACC and the OMME 
Instruction Team if you have any 
questions about this.
