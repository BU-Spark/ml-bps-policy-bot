All work requests are to be submitted through Asset Essentials. 
The following procedures are to be followed when originating 
work requests. 
ASSET ESSENTIALS  
You will be able to login through your Google App launcher, 
which is the icon at the top of your Gmail (3 by 3 box.) Scroll down 
until you see the "SchoolDude - Asset Essentials" icon.  
REQUEST FORMAT 
Each request begins by selecting the school from the drop-down 
menu. Please provide a detailed description of the work needed, 
including the floor, room number, and room name (if there is

address for return messages.

any emergency. After calling in the emergency, enter the 
emergency Work Order Request into the system by the end of 
the day, indicating that it was an emergency, and the request is a 
confirming order. 
EXTERNAL FUNDS 
If the costs are to be charged to an external funding source, 
indicate in the request to what account the costs should be 
charged.  Refer to Superintendent’s Circular — External Funding 
of Renovations to School Buildings and Yards. 
STATUS OF WORK ORDER REQUESTS 
Once a Work Order Request has been submitted for initial 
review, you will be able to view the status and actions taken by 
Planning and Engineering staff on the initial request. 
Status codes are as follows: 
● In Progress - We have decided to move forward with 
obtaining an estimate from a contractor.  Once we have 
obtained an estimate from a contractor, we will assess and 
make a final decision.   
● On Hold - The decision has been made to put this on hold 
for right now. You will be able to view the status and actions 
taken by Planning and Engineering staff on the initial 
request. There will be a detailed note explaining this 
decision.  
● Denied - The decision has been made to not proceed with 
this work order. You will be able to view the status and 
actions taken by Planning and Engineering staff on the

initial request. There will be a detailed note explaining this 
decision.  
● Capital Project - This has been deemed to be a capital 
project and so it has been forwarded to the Capital Project 
team.  
● Completed - Once a supervisor has provided estimated 
costs, contractors to complete the work, and estimated 
completion date, and a final decision has been rendered, 
you will be able to review the status and actions taken by 
Planning and Engineering staff. 
► Please note that, for most approved work orders, you 
generally will not receive a note. If your request is put On 
Hold, Denied, or Capital Project, you will generally receive a 
note explaining the reason for the decision.
