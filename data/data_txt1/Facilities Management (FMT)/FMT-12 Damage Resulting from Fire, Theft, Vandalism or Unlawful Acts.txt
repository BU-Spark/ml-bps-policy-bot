Circular 
NUMBER: 
FMT-12 
Version 01 
 
 
 
LOSS OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM FIRE, THEFT, 
VANDALISM OR UNLAWFUL ACTS  
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
In all cases of loss or damage to Boston School Department 
buildings, grounds, or other property, heads of school, principals, 
and responsibility center managers must complete Form A 
(attached) and follow prescribed procedures upon the discovery 
of such incidents. Form A is to be used to report all acts of fire, 
theft, vandalism, destruction of property, graffiti, breaking and 
entering, and attempts to break and enter. Vandalism is 
considered to be all willful acts causing damage to school 
department property.  
Heads of school, principals, and other responsibility center 
managers must also contact the Boston Police or Safety Services 
and request that an official Police Department incident report 
(commonly referred to as a “1-1”) be prepared. This report serves 
as documentation that the incident has been reported to and 
logged by the Police Department. Heads of school, principals, 
and responsibility center managers should keep a copy of both 
Form A and the official police report for their records.  
The original Form A and a copy of the police report are to be sent 
to the Department of Safety Services, 213 Townsend Street, 
Dorchester, MA 02121.
