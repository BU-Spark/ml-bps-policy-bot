Superintendent’s 
Circular 
NUMBER: 
FSE-05 
Version 01 
 
 
 
MEDICAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT 
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
The following guidelines relate to a medical emergency of an 
individual student, which is different from episodes where the 
entire School Safety Contingency Plan (please refer to 
Superintendent’s Circular FSE-01 School Safety Contingency 
Plans) is activated. However, the guidelines are complementary. 
The school nurse assigned to each school should assist in the 
development and implementation of medical emergency 
protocols. The elements to be included in the protocol are 
described below. 
EMERGENCY INFORMATION  
Prevention of medical emergencies begins with knowledge of 
underlying medical issues. Therefore, Emergency Information 
Cards (Form 460 or electronic equivalent), containing the basic 
pertinent data to activate an emergency medical plan for the 
student, must be on file at each school. This information should 
be completed upon the opening of school in September and 
updated by January 1 and again by April 1 each school year. 
In addition to parental contact phone numbers, alternate 
emergency contacts, primary language spoken at home and

custody issue documentation, the card or electronic equivalent 
should contain: 
● Insurance company 
● Policy number 
● Clinician name and phone 
● Hospital where the child is taken in an emergency 
● Listing of health problems 
● Listing of medications taken at home as well as in school 
● Allergies 
● Vision or hearing problems 
● History of surgery or serious illness in the last year 
Each building administrator may practice the most expeditious 
means of securing necessary information. 
ROUTINE ILLNESS / MINOR INJURY 
It is the responsibility of the principal/head of school, in 
consultation with the school nurse, to decide whether routinely ill 
or slightly injured students should remain in school or be 
released to their home. When it is necessary for a student to 
leave the school for home, the following procedures must be 
followed. 
● The parent/guardian, or in those cases where they cannot 
be contacted, the individual designated on the Emergency 
Information Card, should make necessary arrangements for 
the student to be picked up at school by a responsible adult. 
(Please refer to Superintendent’s Circular SAF-08 Release of 
Students to Authorized Persons.)

Page 3 of 12 
 
 
 
● The parent/guardian should be informed of any emergency 
aid administered at the school and advised to seek further 
medical attention, if necessary. 
● If the parent/guardian of a student who has sustained a 
minor injury or illness cannot be located, the child must 
remain in school until the regular dismissal time. 
● Under no circumstances should a student be released 
without adequate adult supervision. All instances where a 
student is released should be properly documented in a log 
in the office of the principal/head of school. The log must 
indicate all pertinent information, including the time the 
child arrived home. 
● No child is to be released to anyone other than a 
parent/guardian without the parent/guardian’s consent 
and proper identification as the parent/guardian’s 
designee. 
MEDICAL EMERGENCIES 
The principal/head of school has administrative and 
programmatic responsibility for all activities that occur in their 
school. However, in those cases where a medical emergency 
exists, principals/heads of school should consult with and follow 
the advice of the assigned nursing staff.  
● A medical emergency is defined generally as a potentially 
life-limiting or life-threatening situation requiring 
immediate medical attention, as well as cases of indecent 
assault/rape. Protocols for the management of specific 
medical emergencies are available to nurses and are to be 
kept on file in the nurse's office. 


Page 4:
Superintendent’s Circular FSE-05 
Page 4 of 12 
 
 
 
● In the beginning of each school year, school nurses should 
communicate to relevant staff the known potential health 
emergencies of individual students. This meeting should be 
documented on the student’s Individual Health Plan. 
● The principal/head of school is responsible for responding to 
medical emergencies when a school nurse is not available.  
● Principals/heads of school should compile a list of staff with 
CPR, AED, first aid, and first responder training who can 
provide immediate lifesaving measures until EMS arrives. 
These staff members should be members of the School 
Safety Team. 
● Immediate phone support is also available through the 
Health Services office at 617-635-6788. 
● Each school nurse should complete a list of staff trained in 
the administration of Epinephrine in the event of a life-
threatening allergic reaction. This list must remain on the 
file with the school administrator. Epinephrine should not 
be locked away but should be available to school staff in a 
secure location. 
● It is recommended that the school nurse, school leader, and 
other staff involved in a medical emergency hold a debrief 
meeting following the incident. 
SERIOUS INJURY / ILLNESS PROTOCOL 
● Stabilize the student using the most qualified school staff. 
● Activate the Emergency Medical System (EMS) by calling 911. 
Cases of indecent assault/rape require Boston Police 
notification via 911.* 


Page 5:
Superintendent’s Circular FSE-05 
Page 5 of 12 
 
 
 
● Call the Superintendent’s Office at 617-635-9057. 
● Notify School Safety Services at 617-635-8000. 
● The responding ambulance crew of emergency medical 
technicians (EMTs) or paramedics will consult with the 
qualified school officials and assess the need for 
transportation to a medical facility. EMS assumes medical 
management of the child. 
● School personnel designated by the principal/head of school 
must accompany the student in the ambulance and remain 
with the child until a) the parent/guardian arrives or, b) the 
child is attended to by appropriate and qualified medical 
personnel who have taken over the custody of the child, 
whichever occurs first.  
● Accompanying staff are not required to have medical 
experience and are present solely for the comfort of the 
child. It is not recommended that the school nurse 
accompany the student as the school will be without 
nursing support for other students requiring nursing care 
during the school day and other first aid/emergency care.  
● The school’s representative should bring the student’s 
Emergency Information Card, the Individual Collaborative 
Health Plan (if the student has identified chronic health 
needs), emergency action plan (if available), and all other 
pertinent medical information to the hospital. 
● If the emergency occurs on the school bus, the driver 
(and/or monitor, if present) will provide for the safety of the 
child and call the dispatcher, who notifies 911. When EMS 
arrives, the dispatcher will be called with the name of the 
child and the hospital that the child will be transported to.

The dispatcher then calls the Department of Safety Services 
at 617-635- 8000, who will notify the family. A safety officer 
will proceed to the emergency room to meet with the 
student and family. 
➢ Release of a student who is a victim of indecent 
assault/rape must comply with procedures outlined in 
both this memorandum and Superintendent’s Circular 
SAF-08 Release of Students to Authorized Persons. 
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES 
Massachusetts General Law and public health regulations govern 
the reporting and control of communicable diseases in public 
schools. All suspected cases of a communicable disease require 
confirmation from local health authorities before a plan of action 
is developed. When a student is suspected of having a reportable 
communicable disease: 
● The principal/head of school or designee will contact the 
school nurse. 
● The nurse or principal/head of school will contact the Health 
Services administration. 
● Health Services will contact and collaborate with the Public 
Health Commission to confirm the diagnosis. 
● The school nurse, in conjunction with principal/head of 
school or designee, Health Services, and local health 
authorities, will assess the health risks and develop a plan of 
action to address the issues. 
Questions or concerns may be directed to Health Services at 617-
635-6788.
