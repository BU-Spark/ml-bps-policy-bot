Circular 
 NUMBER: 
SHS-11 
Version 01 
 
 
 
 LIFE-THREATENING ALLERGIES (LTA OR ANAPHYLAXIS) 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded by a 
subsequent version 
POLICY 
The Massachusetts Department of Education recommends that 
all school districts have policies and protocols regarding the care 
of students with life-threatening food allergies. This is in addition 
to 2012, c.77, An Act Relative to Medical Emergency Response 
Plans for Schools, requiring local school districts to develop 
efficient written medical response plans for responding to life-
threatening emergencies.  
 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health Regulations 
governing the Administration of Prescription Medications in 
Public and Private Schools 105 C.M.R. 210.100(A)(4) and (A)(4)(c)(iv) 
authorize school personnel who are trained and tested for 
competency to administer epinephrine by auto-injector to 
individuals with previously diagnosed life-threatening allergies 
who are experiencing an anaphylactic event. School districts 
must be registered with the Massachusetts Department of Public 
Health for this purpose.

BACKGROUND ON ANAPHYLAXIS 
Anaphylaxis is a sudden, severe, potentially fatal, systemic allergic 
reaction that can involve various areas of the body (such as the 
skin, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and cardiovascular 
system). Symptoms occur within minutes to two hours after 
contact with the allergy-causing substance, but in rare instances 
may occur up to four hours later.  Anaphylactic reactions can be 
mild to life-threatening. The annual incidence of anaphylactic 
reactions is about 30 per 100,000 persons, and individuals with 
asthma, eczema, or hay fever are at a greater relative risk of 
experiencing anaphylaxis. The most common allergens in 
children are food and bee-sting. 
Because of the life-threatening nature of this condition, it is 
important for schools to develop and implement care plans for all 
children identified with life-threatening allergic reactions. 
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations 
provides for the administration of epinephrine by auto-injector by 
non-medical personnel who have been trained by the school 
nurse in the administration of epinephrine by auto-injector 
delivery. In consultation with the school physician, the school 
nurse leader has the final decision-making authority about the 
program, which must be in accordance with MA DPH standards. 
This includes school-sponsored programs as well as before and 
after school when a nurse is not immediately available. 
The Boston School Committee, as part of the Superintendent's 
Circular SHS-08 Medication Administration, has approved the 
training of administration of epinephrine by auto-injector for 
students with identified allergies under the supervision of the

school nurse. 
The purpose of these Administrative Procedures and Guidelines 
is to: 
• Provide a safe and healthy learning environment for all 
students 
• Protect the rights of students with food allergies to 
participate in all school activities 
• Reduce the likelihood of severe or potentially life-
threatening allergic reactions during school 
• Ensure a rapid and effective response in the case of a 
severe or potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. 
 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
Staff to be trained includes, but are not limited to, teachers, 
paraprofessionals, food service staff, school leaders, support staff, 
and student interns/teachers.  
Education and training by the school nurse will include: 
• Identification of potential food allergens  
• Role and responsibilities in the prevention and reducing 
risks 
• Recognizing allergic reactions 
• Responding to an allergic reaction 
• How to administer an epinephrine auto-injector 
(EpiPen®).
