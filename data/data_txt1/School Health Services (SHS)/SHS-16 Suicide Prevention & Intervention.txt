Circular 
NUMBER: 
SHS-16 
Version 01 
 
 
 
SUICIDE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded by a 
subsequent version 
POLICY STATEMENT 
It is the policy of the Boston Public Schools (BPS) to provide an 
array of services for students through the utilization of internal 
and external support resources to promote their social and 
emotional growth and well-being. In those cases where 
individual students are at-risk or in-crisis, all staff will collaborate 
in providing those supports needed to ensure the student’s 
safety and well-being. When there is an acute crisis within the 
school community, staff will collaborate, under the direction of 
the building administrator and with support from the Behavioral 
Health Services District Crisis Team (as needed/appropriate), in 
addressing those problems and issues raised by that death 
among students, staff, and parents. 
POLICY GUIDELINES 
The following policy guidelines have been established to address 
the issue of suicide prevention and intervention and will be 
followed in all schools: 
1. All staff should be aware of suicide distress signals and 
symptoms outlined herein. 
2. All staff have an obligation to be knowledgeable about and 


Page 2:
Superintendent’s Circular SHS-16 
Page 2 of 18 
 
 
 
to cooperate fully in the implementation of the BPS Suicide 
Prevention and Intervention Policy Statement and Policy 
Guidelines. 
3. Building administrators will provide leadership in 
addressing the issue of suicide prevention and intervention 
and will establish and maintain the following support 
mechanisms required to address the issue within the wider 
school community: 
a. Implement prevention and intervention strategies 
according to a multi-tiered system of support (MTSS) 
framework.  
b. Be sure that staff is knowledgeable about the purpose 
of the Student Success Team (SST), its membership, 
and the process for making referrals to the team. 
c. Ensure the provision of in-service training for staff in 
the fall of each school year concerning the issues of 
suicide/crisis intervention and prevention, including 
suicide risk assessment procedures. 
d. Establish and maintain linkages with appropriate 
community-based support agencies that will assist the 
school in addressing this issue. 
e. Provide information and services to students with a 
view to implementing fully the letter and spirit of the 
Boston Public Schools Suicide Prevention and 
Intervention Policy. 
Finally, it is paramount to highlight that racism undermines 
mental health. Therefore, BPS is committed to culturally and 
linguistically sustaining practices (CLSP) in all that is done in 
supporting students and families. This means that we pledge to 
work against individual racism, interpersonal racism, and 
institutional racism in all their forms by creating systems that

work for our students and families. It is also well understood that 
there is an increased risk of suicide amongst traditionally 
marginalized groups, particularly in LGBTQ+ students.  
KEY TERMS 
It is essential that all Boston Public Schools staff understand the 
following terms. 
Suicide: Death caused by self-directed injurious behavior with 
intent to die as a result of the behavior. 
Suicide Attempt: A non-fatal, self-directed, potentially injurious 
behavior with at least some intent to die as a result of the 
behavior. 
Suicidal Ideation: Thinking about, considering, or planning 
suicide1. 
Self-Injury:  The act of deliberately harming one’s own body, 
such as cutting or burning, as a way to cope with emotional 
pain2.  
TIERED PREVENTION & INTERVENTION STRATEGIES 
It should be the goal of the school community to work together, 
under the leadership of the building administrator, to establish 
and maintain a program of suicide prevention. Schools are 
important settings for suicide prevention for the following 
reasons: school personnel interact regularly with students and 
play an important role in keeping students safe; suicide has a

negative impact on an entire school community; and creating 
and maintaining a safe and supportive learning environment is 
part of the mission of BPS3. Prevention efforts should follow an 
MTSS continuum, with low-intensity prevention efforts for all 
students and more intensive prevention efforts for those with 
higher risk. The following prevention and intervention strategies 
are strongly recommended as part of a school-based suicide 
prevention approach. 
 Tier 1 Prevention 
School Climate 
and Culture 
Building a safe and supportive school 
climate is a vital step in suicide prevention. 
Schools should consider how they are 
teaching kids to ask for help and how they 
are creating safe spaces for relationship-
building.

Universal 
Behavioral Health 
Screening 
Using a universal behavioral health 
screening tool (e.g. BIMAS-2) at least twice 
per year helps schools assess students’ 
level of risk and identify appropriate 
prevention strategies.

Knowing Risk 
Factors & Warning 
Signs 
Ensure that all staff are familiar with 
suicide symptoms and report student 
concerns to the building administrator in a 
timely fashion. (See page 9-10 for a list of 
warning signs along with common risk and 
protective factors.)

 Tier 2 Prevention & Intervention Strategies 
Structures and protocols to address and provide support to 
students presenting at risk. 
Person(s) 
Responsible 
Response Protocol 
Student Success 
Team (SST) 
The SST should provide a systematic 
process for identifying and addressing the 
needs of students in need of support 
services and emphasize suicide prevention 
strategies. This can consist of guardian 
contact regarding concerns, referral to a 
partner or other agency for provision of 
services, such as group counseling, etc. 
 
 Tier 3 Intervention Strategies  
All school staff should be familiar with intervention strategies and 
protocols and be trained once per year. Different levels of 
intervention (suicide risk assessment, safety planning, 
emergency response, and postvention) are required, depending 
on the nature and seriousness of the situation. 
1. Student has made suicidal gestures or statements. 
The BPS Suicide Risk Assessment (SRA) should be initiated 
immediately if there is concern that a student has thoughts 
about suicide. The SRA will guide the process for (1) gathering 
information about the concern, (2) developing an appropriate 
intervention plan, and (3) documenting both.

RELEASING STUDENTS TO PARENT/CAREGIVER 
The head of school/principal or designee should release the 
student to the parent after: 
• Providing the parent/caregiver with the name of a medical 
person, a mental health worker, or a resource agency 
• Urging the parent to immediately bring the student to that 
person or agency 
• Urging the parent to provide the school with any follow-up 
information that may be forthcoming from medical or 
mental health personnel in order for the school to better 
provide for the student 
If a parent/caregiver or emergency contact cannot be contacted 


Page 13:
Superintendent’s Circular SHS-16 
Page 13 of 18 
 
 
 
after two hours, Department of Children and Families should be 
contacted at the hot line (1-800-792-5200) and/or emergency 
medical procedures should be implemented. Under no 
circumstances should a child be allowed to go home without a 
parent/guardian. The student should be kept at the school until a 
DCF worker arrives. In these cases, schools should initiate the 
procedures in Supertintendent’s Circular SUP-20, Child Abuse 
and Neglect Procedures. 
REFERRAL TO EXTERNAL SUPPORT AGENCIES 
It is recommended that all students, both those “in-crisis” and 
those who have exhibited or expressed any symptoms of suicide, 
be referred for support by external agencies with staff trained 
and experienced in providing suicide intervention. 
RETURNING TO SCHOOL 
All students returning to school after a period of absence are 
required to bring notes of explanation/excuse for the absence, 
signed by the parent/guardian. For students returning to school 
after emergency treatment for suicide intervention, schools 
should make all reasonable efforts to obtain documentation from 
a medical/mental health provider indicating that the student is 
able and safe to return to school. Failure of the school to receive 
such documentation, however, will not be grounds for excluding 
the student from school. Those students unable to return for 
medical or mental health reasons after a crisis situation may 
qualify for services under the provisions of Superintendent’s 
Circular SSS-19 Home and Hospital Instruction. 
All returning students should report first to the school nurse (or 
other trained student support staff, such as the school 


Page 14:
Superintendent’s Circular SHS-16

psychologist or social worker), who will take the following 
actions: 
1. Review and file the letter from the medical/mental health 
provider as part of a confidential health record. 
2. Accompany the student to the homeroom for re-admission. 
Every effort should be made to do this with sensitivity and to 
maintain as great a degree of confidentiality as possible. 
3. Inform the head of school/principal of the student’s return. 
4. Bring the case to the school’s SST for review and assignment 
of an internal liaison person. 
This liaison person will monitor the student’s re-entry and serve 
as the person to whom staff should report recurring warning 
signs. The liaison might be a homeroom or subject area teacher, 
a school psychologist, a guidance counselor, the nurse, or other 
member of the faculty who is trusted by the student. The liaison 
might also serve as the link with the parent/guardian concerning 
the student’s status and, with written permission of the 
parent/guardian, serve as a liaison with any external agency staff 
providing special support to the student.
