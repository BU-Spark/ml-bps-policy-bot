This Superintendent’s Circular provides instructions for 
implementing the Field Trip Policy passed by the Boston School 
Committee on November 20, 2019. 
This circular MUST be read in its entirety by program leaders 
(chaperones), principal/head of school and/or the district 
department sponsoring a field trip that includes an IN the water 
or ON the water activity. These parties are responsible for 
ensuring that all field trip policies and procedures as outlined in 
this circular AND all applicable field trip circulars (CAO-23, 24, 
and 25) are adhered to. 
WATER ACTIVITIES 
• If your trip involves ON or IN water activities, you must 


Page 2:

Page 2 of 13 
 
contact the Department of Global Education immediately 
to submit a mandatory Water Activity Request Form 16 
weeks in advance to ensure that the site location for the 
water activity has up-to-date insurance, a safety plan, and 
certification documentation on file with the district. 
• For water activities: The student-to-chaperone ratio must 
remain 10:1 at all times during swimming for all grade 
levels. (This ratio does not include the lifeguards on duty.) 
SWIMMING (IN THE WATER) 
• Instructional swimming is permitted only if proper 
swimmer-lifeguard ratios are maintained (20:1); the 
swimming teachers hold valid American Red Cross or 
YMCA Lifeguard Instruction/ Water Safety Instruction, 
CPR/AED, and First Aid certificates; the site is nationally 
recognized for swim instruction (e.g., YMCA); and 
parents/guardians are informed in the appropriate 
Parental Authorization for Field Trip form. 
Parents/guardians must be given sufficient information 
to understand the nature and scope of the activity(s).  
• Principal/head of school is responsible for ensuring these 
requirements are met and must receive written 
documentation of all listed guard and instructor 
certifications. Copies of these certifications, along with 
students’ permission slips, must be kept on file for the 
current fiscal year plus three additional years. 
• Therapeutic/adaptive swimming for students with 
disabilities is permitted only with individuals with 
Therapeutic/Adaptive Swim certification or licensure 
and proper swimmer-lifeguard ratios are maintained

(10:1); and parents/guardians are informed in the 
appropriate Parental Authorization for Field Trip form. 
Parents/guardians must be given sufficient information 
to understand the nature and scope of the activity(s). 
• Recreational swimming is NOT permitted on BPS field 
trips.  
WATER ACTIVITIES (ON THE WATER) 
• Water activities are permitted involving larger 
commercial or passenger vessels which meet U.S. Coast 
Guard standards for safety and hold a valid Certification of 
Compliance for the state or its international equivalent 
(Please note: There must be one life jacket per 
passenger). In addition, be sure the water-related activity 
is clearly listed in the appropriate Parental Authorization 
for Field Trip form. Parents/guardians must be given 
sufficient information to understand the nature and 
scope of the activity(s). 
• Water activities such as kayaking, rowing, and canoeing 
(or the equivalent where the movement of a craft 
depends on the physical endurance of its operator) and 
travel in small watercraft are not permitted on a BPS field 
trip unless a request is submitted and approved by the 
district. (Please note: There must be one life jacket per 
passenger.) These requests are submitted to and 
reviewed by the Department of Global Education. 
Significant lead time is needed (16 weeks or more) to 
allow for safety requirements to be met. 
• The sponsoring water venue/facility must provide the 
following documents to the district annually: 1) Safety 


Page 4:
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-27 
Page 4 of 13 
 
Plan; 2) Liability Insurance; and 3) Lifeguard Certification.  
CHAPERONE REQUIREMENTS: 
• The program leader (lead chaperone) must be a BPS 
employee.  Other authorized chaperones may include 
parents and guardians 21 years of age or older.  
• Chaperones must be equipped with hand sanitizer and 
additional masks if the need arises for staff and students.  
• All chaperones must complete the Chaperone Agreement 
Form.  
• All non-BPS employee chaperones must submit a 
yearly CORI/SORI authorization form to the Office of 
Human Capital. Complete the eCORI form online at this 
link. Contact the BPS Office of Human Capital (OHC) for 
CORI check and confirmation support.  The 
principal/head of school and the lead chaperone are 
responsible for submitting authorization forms to OHC 
and must not allow chaperones to take part in activities 
until they have been CORI/SORI cleared. Non-BPS 
employee chaperones (parents/guardians) must show 
proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test within 24 
hours of the field trip. Non-BPS employees who 
chaperone on a field trip are not covered for liability by 
the Boston Public Schools. 
• The program leader must be sure that all chaperones, 
including non-BPS chaperones, are informed of, adhere 
to, and uphold the BPS Code of Conduct and other 
district and school-based rules. 
• Chaperones who are parents/guardians of BPS students 


Page 5:
Superintendent’s Circular CAO-27 
Page 5 of 13 
 
on the trip must provide the same level of care and 
attention to ALL student participants. If a BPS 
chaperone’s child who does not attend the participating 
school must attend the program, the child must be a BPS 
student and in the same grade or age range as 
participating students. In this case, the BPS employee is 
responsible for incurring all costs associated with their 
child’s participation.  
• Tour guides and employees of third-party vendors 
contracted to help operate the trip are not considered 
chaperones and do not factor into the student-to-
chaperone ratio.   
➤ For Day & Water Field Trips, the Department of Safety Services 
(617-635-8000), must be notified in the event of a serious medical 
or other emergency and should be used as a resource for 
questions regarding safety on day field trips, including WATER 
ACTIVITY day trips.

WATER ACTIVITY REQUEST FORM 
 
DIRECTIONS:   
1. This form must be submitted for water activities at least 
16 weeks in advance for the proposed water activity to be 
considered.  Please email this form to 
OPL@bostonpublicschools.org and confirm its receipt.   
2. One form should be completed per field trip. However, if 
there are multiple “water activities” planned, each water 
experience must be listed separately. For example, if you 
are taking students on a service-learning trip for one 
week and would like students to participate in a water 
activity on multiple days, each separate excursion should 
be listed, even if the excursion is at the same location.   
3. Requests will be reviewed and schools will receive an 
answer regarding their requests in 2-3 weeks.
