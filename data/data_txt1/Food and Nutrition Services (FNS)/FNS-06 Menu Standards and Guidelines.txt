FOOD AND NUTRITION SERVICES MENU AND 
INGREDIENT GUIDELINES  
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
The Boston Public Schools (BPS) Food and Nutrition Services 
(FNS) Menu and Ingredient Guidelines are the benchmarks for 
food quality, food safety, nutrition, and variety. They are applied 
primarily to menu development and procurement and support 
the Nutrition Standard of Food and Nutrition Services. They 
pertain to all USDA programs administered by FNS. 
FNS continuously monitors its work related to these guidelines 
and updates them annually between school years. The guidelines 
are informed by sources of evidence-based research, and ad hoc 
related to ingredients and standards for operation. 
FNS Menu and Ingredient Guidelines align with the Good Food 
Purchasing Program and continuously strive to meet the Menus 
of Change Principles of the Culinary Institute of America. These 
values and principles, respectively, are embedded within the FNS 
Menu and Ingredient Guidelines. 
The Menu and Ingredient Guidelines are grouped below under 
the following headings:

A. Provide nourishing and culturally diverse food choices 
according to regulations  
B. Offer variety of whole, fresh, local foods 
C. Establish levels for some fats, sugar, sodium  
D. Eliminate additives 
E. Define animal welfare standards 
F. Other 
 
A. Provide nourishing and culturally diverse food choices that 
meet or exceed USDA National School Lunch and School 
Breakfast Program guidelines as well as guidelines of 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health, City of Boston, 
and Boston Public Schools Wellness Policy.  
FNS strictly follows or exceeds the USDA National School 
Lunch and School Breakfast Programs Meal Pattern for the 
healthy meal choices that it offers and the frequency that 
choices are served. 
For Boston schools:  
• Menus follow at least a four-week cycle and continuously 
evolve for diversity, updates, variety, and trends, reflecting 
student preferences.  
• Menus for all BPS food service models are as much like 
each other as possible. 
• Lunch menus have at least one vegetarian entrée daily 
and feature at least one vegan protein option per menu 
cycle during in-person meal service.

Page 3 of 17 
 
 
 
B. Offer a variety of whole foods that are fresh, high quality, 
emphasize local, and foods, as purchased, that retain most 
of their inherent physical, chemical, sensory and nutritional 
properties. These foods should meet the food quality 
requirement as noted throughout these Guidelines.  
• Menus favor local, seasonal ingredients. Local items are 
featured based on availability, primarily on salad bars, as 
well as one or more additional local meal components 
during the week, to include whole grains, fish, and dairy, 
within budget parameters. Local, defined as New 
England, is intended to increase in volume over time for 
all service models. 
• Menus offer a variety of fruits and vegetables.  
o FNS offers at least two fruits (minimum one fresh; may 
also serve unsweetened canned/frozen, packed in its 
own juice, and dried fruit at breakfast and lunch)  
o FNS offers at least three fresh vegetables and one fresh 
fruit daily at schools (MWCs) with salad bars. Schools 
without salad bars offer a minimum of one or more 
fresh fruit and/or vegetables daily.  
o Frozen and canned vegetables (salt-free or low-
sodium) may be served, as appropriate. 
o Legumes/beans are offered at a minimum of once per 
week at all sites for lunch. 
• Menus offer legumes and beans as a plant-based protein 
option to meet the meat alternate component 
requirements of meal pattern.  
• Menus will provide all the weekly grains as whole grain-
rich and offered in salad bars, sides, and entrees. Local

Page 4 of 17 
 
 
 
whole grain-rich items will be featured. 
• Menus offer a variety of lean proteins, including animal 
and plant-based options (i.e.., chicken, turkey, beef, fish, 
tofu, beans). Menus offer commercially purchased whole 
muscle meat or entrees made from whole muscle meat, 
with no fillers. 
• Beef is lean, USDA Grade Choice or better, and contains 
100% beef only. 
• Eggs are USDA Grade A or equivalent and USDA 
inspected; frozen eggs are USDA inspected.  
• Seafood must be U.S. Department of Commerce-
inspected. 
• FNS offers foods that have as little packaging as possible, 
with the goal of eliminating all but reasonable, necessary 
packaging. Packaged foods include those served 
selectively, at the discretion of FNS and primarily in 
settings that have no cooking equipment, for Breakfast in 
the Classroom, field trips, and occasionally for grab-and-
go carts. Where possible, meals offered in the classroom, 
for field trips and on carts align with meals offered in 
dining rooms. 
• FNS is moving away from unitized/packaged meals 
toward on-site meal preparation.  
C. Decrease the amount of saturated fat, monitor added 
sugar and excess sodium.  
• Menu choices favor entrees that are low in saturated fat 
(less than 10% based on the average for a 5-day menu 
week).

• Healthy oil(s) are used in most food preparation. Butter is 
used sparingly. 
• All liquid milk is rBGH-free. 
• All dairy is low fat (1%) or non-fat (skim), excluding butter.  
• FNS currently observes USDA Target 1 sodium limits: 
o In line with the federal rules, on or before school year 
2024-2025, FNS intends to decrease average daily 
sodium levels to reach Target 2 standards established 
by the USDA Final Rule “Nutrition Standards in the 
National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs 
(1/26/12)”. 
• Added sugar content is monitored by following the below 
guidelines, with the aim to decrease daily added sugar 
intake: 
o Cereal may contain no more than 6 gm added sugar 
(1.5 teaspoons) (for 1 grain equivalent) and must be 
identical nutritional/ingredients with retail product. 
o Breakfast grain/grain components may contain up to 8 
gm (2 teaspoons) added sugar. 
o For two grain equivalents, there will be no more than 
14 gm (4.5 teaspoons) added sugar. 
o Yogurt may have 15 gm of added sugar (4.5+ 
teaspoons) or less per serving. 
• Beverages may include fruit-infused water at hydration 
stations in school dining rooms.  
D. Eliminate additives and ingredients that aren’t needed for 
product integrity.

Page 7:
Superintendent’s Circular FNS-06 
Page 7 of 17 
 
 
 
o Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO)  
o Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and Polysorbates 
• Flour treatment agents: (azodicarbonamide, bleached 
flour, bromated flour [potassium bromate], potassium 
iodate) 
• Nitrites/Nitrates and Processed Meat: Meat that has been 
transformed through salting., curing, fermentation, 
smoking, or other processes to enhance flavor or improve 
preservation. Examples of processed meat include hot 
dogs (frankfurters), deli meat, ham, sausage, corned beef, 
beef jerky and canned meat. 
• Rendered meat, irradiated meat, meat with latent Tgf-
beta binding protein (LTBP)* 
• Ammonium hydroxide, vegetable protein analogues, or 
extenders 
E. Work toward procurement of animals untreated with 
hormones, steroids, or antibiotics that serve no vital 
function. 
• Due to growing concerns of animal husbandry practices, 
FNS supports responsible use of antibiotics in animals.  
o Menu features chickens raised without the use of 
antibiotics ever. 
▪ Menu features entrees utilizing chicken products 
following One Health Certified (OHC) standards.37 
OHC addresses several important areas of animal 
agriculture within a sustainable continuous 
improvement process. 
o Menu features turkey products produced under a 


Page 8:
Superintendent’s Circular FNS-06 
Page 8 of 17 
 
 
 
USDA process verified program that includes 
compliance with the following Certified Responsible 
Antibiotic Use (CRAU) criteria: 
i. No administration of antibiotics pre-hatch 
ii. Antibiotics with analogues in human medicine are 
not allowed for: 
▪ Disease prevention 
▪ Growth promotion 
▪ Feed efficiency, or 
▪ Weight gain 
iii. Antibiotics with human analogs can only be used 
therapeutically to: 
• Treat disease in poultry with bacterial disease  
• Control disease in poultry exposed to infectious 
bacteria 
• FNS is opposed to the use of hormones and steroid 
growth promoters in beef and dairy cattle production. 
FNS continues to research food products from beef or 
dairy cattle produced without hormone growth 
promoters and grass-fed products as options become 
available. FNS acknowledges some USDA commodity 
products (beef, dairy and poultry) are purchased without 
the transparency of animal practices, and therefore, FNS 
limits how often these products are served. USDA 
commodity proteins may be made from whole muscle 
meat or restructured meat*. 
F. Other guidelines are observed as follows:

• All school dining areas are peanut aware. No school 
kitchens will serve peanuts or tree nuts. 
• FNS accommodates students with medically prescribed 
dietary requirements.
