Superintendent’s 
Circular 
NUMBER:  
SAF-04 
Version 01 
 
INCIDENT DATA AND NOTIFICATIONS                         
 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded by a 
subsequent version 
 
It is Boston Public Schools’ policy that all building administrators 
and responsibility center managers report all incidents 
completely, promptly, and accurately to the Department of 
Safety Services and appropriate public safety agencies. 
Administrators and responsibility center managers must be 
aware that often an incident occurring at one site may 
precipitate a similar or related incident at another site. Timely 
reporting of incidents will help ensure a prompt and appropriate 
response by the School Department, public safety agencies, and 
other agencies whose support may be required. 
 
In addition to reporting all incidents to the Department of Safety 
Services, building administrators and responsibility center 
managers must report all serious incidents to the 
Superintendent’s Office and to the appropriate assistant 
superintendent. Serious incidents are considered to be those that 
require or precipitate the assistance of the Police Department, 
Fire Department, Emergency Medical Services, or the 
Department of Children and Families in other than a routine and 
ancillary manner. Any situation that could result in the request 
for the closing of a school building is also to be considered a 
serious incident reportable to the Superintendent’s Office and 
the appropriate assistant superintendent. Since personnel from 
the superintendent’s staff work with city officials to address 
many of these issues and the Office of Communications

coordinates responses to media inquiries, it is imperative that the 
Superintendent’s Office be notified of serious incidents in a 
timely manner. 
 
Building administrators and responsibility center managers must 
immediately notify the appropriate public safety agency by way 
of the 911 emergency telephone line of any situation that poses 
imminent danger. These calls should be made by the on-site 
administrator or manager using conventional or cellular 
telephones. The School Department’s two-way radio system is 
not designed to access 911 emergency services and should only 
be used when conventional or cellular telephones are 
unavailable.   
 
When accessing emergency services through the enhanced 911 
system, the caller must give the complete address, succinctly 
state the nature of the problem, and follow any instructions 
issued by the dispatcher.   
 
The following chart lists some typical incidents occurring on 
School Department grounds, and the appropriate order of 
notifications to be made.
