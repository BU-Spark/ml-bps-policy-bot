Superintendent’s 
Circular 
NUMBER: 
SAF-08 
Version 01 
 
RELEASE OF STUDENTS TO AUTHORIZED PERSONS 
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded by a 
subsequent version 
School leaders/principals must use extraordinary care in releasing 
a child to a parent or guardian. Such care should be further 
emphasized when an administrator has been informed that a 
court order exists prohibiting release of that child to a certain 
person or persons.  It is essential to exercise extreme caution in 
this area to prevent a parent or guardian from attempting to 
remove a child from school. It is both essential and mandatory 
that school leaders/principals regularly update the Student 
Emergency Information Card (Form 460). 
If telephone notification is received from a parent or guardian to 
release a student to a third party, it is the responsibility of the 
building administrator to verify.  A suggested procedure is to ask 
for the telephone number from which the party is calling, cross-
check that number with the information from the emergency 
card, and then call the party back at that number. 
School leaders/principals must require proper identification from 
any person removing a child from school.  No child is to be 
released to anyone other than a custodial parent without the 
parent's consent and proper identification. 
School leaders/principals should note that the Department of 
Children and Families (DCF) has statutory authority to take

immediate custody of any child if DCF has reasonable cause to 
believe that such action is necessary to protect the child from 
abuse or neglect.  In such cases, the child will be brought before 
the court on the next business day. Such emergency measures 
are usually taken without the consent of the parent.  However, 
before school leaders/principals release any child to an agent of 
the DCF, the agent should be required to present their official 
photo identification and prepare a simple signed statement to 
the effect that the Department of Children and Families is 
exercising its authority to take immediate custody of the child on 
the grounds of suspected abuse or neglect. 
Under no circumstances should a child be sent to any location by 
way of a taxicab, or any other transportation service based solely 
on notification received by telephone. 
School leaders/principals having doubts about the release of a 
student should immediately contact the Boston Police 
Department by calling 911 and Boston Public Schools Safety 
Services Department at 617-635-8000. 
There are some situations in which parents have authorized a 
third party to transport their children to or from school on a 
regular basis in a van, bus, or some vehicle other than that 
assigned by the BPS Transportation Department. School leaders, 
principals, and program directors must obtain written permission 
from such parents authorizing alternative transportation 
arrangements.  The attached form, Parent Permission to Release 
Student to Authorized Persons, must be completed by the parent 
before administrators put a child into a vehicle operated by a 
third party.

It is important to record the name of the driver, the name of the 
bus company (if applicable), the type of vehicle, and the vehicle 
registration number.  School leaders, principals, and program 
directors are to retain a copy of each completed form.

PARENT PERMISSION TO RELEASE STUDENT TO 
AUTHORIZED PERSONS 
 
The Boston School Department is concerned about the safety 
and wellbeing of all students and consequently will release a

guardian) only with the parent’s or guardian’s written 
authorization.  If you plan to release your child to a third party, 
you must complete this form and return it to the principal of 
your child’s school.
