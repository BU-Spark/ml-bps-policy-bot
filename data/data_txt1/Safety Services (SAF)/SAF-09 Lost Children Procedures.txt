NUMBER: 
SAF-09 
Version 01 
 
 LOST CHILDREN PROCEDURES      
This Circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded by a 
subsequent version 
From time to time, students may be “lost” — that is, a student 
leaves home in the morning but does not arrive at school, or a 
student arrives at school but is missing later in the day, or the 
student may leave school at dismissal and not arrive at home.  The 
following are standard procedures to follow whenever any of these 
scenarios should happen. 
STANDARD PROCEDURES 
The first receiver of information will: 
 
• Gather as much information as possible from the person 
reporting the lost child, including name, student number, 
school address and phone number, bus stop, bus number, 
names of friends/classmates, if known, clothing description, 
and the name and phone number of the caller. 
• Notify Safety Services: Inform the safety specialist assigned or 
present at the building, and they will inform BSP dispatch. If 
there is not a safety specialist at the school, the designated 
school staff should call Safety Services dispatch at 617-635-
8000 to initiate immediate support.  
• Notify the appropriate official: operational leader and school 
superintendent. 
• Notify the principal/head of school and/or program director.

The principal/head of school or program director will:  
• Contact the student’s parent/guardian. 
• Contact teacher(s), student(s), and other(s) who may have 
information about the lost student. 
The operational leader or the school superintendent will: 
 
• Make every effort to assist in locating the student. 
• Once the child is located, arrange to get the child home.  BPS 
Transportation may be used as needed, subject to availability. 
• Notify the first receiver of information and principal/head of 
school of the child's school that the child is located. 
Safety Services will: 
• Notify Boston Police and assist in coordinating the search 
process for lost children. 
• If a transported student, call the bus company (who in turn will 
call the bus driver) and check students who travel on the same 
bus. 
• Notify the Superintendent's Office.
