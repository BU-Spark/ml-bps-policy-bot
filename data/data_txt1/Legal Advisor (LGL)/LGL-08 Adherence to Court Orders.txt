Superintendent’s 
Circular 
NUMBER: 
LGL-08 
Version 01 
 
ADHERENCE TO COURT ORDERS 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
The purpose of this memorandum is to remind Boston Public 
Schools staff of the need to continue to adhere to the court 
orders entered against the District by courts of federal, state, and 
local jurisdiction.  Such orders have the force of law and are 
binding on the District.  Therefore, it is the responsibility of 
administrators and staff of the Boston Public Schools to comply 
with the terms of such orders. 
Additionally, an order by an arbitrator or state agency may also 
require compliance. Heads of school, principals, and other 
administrators may contact the Office of Legal Advisor with 
questions regarding adherence to court orders or the provisions 
of any order.
