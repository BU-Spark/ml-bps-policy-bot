PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF MEMBERS OF THE 
LUNCH HOUR MONITORS ASSOCIATION 
The contract between the School Committee and the Lunch 
Monitors Association provides for both annual and interim 
evaluations of the performance of all employees represented by 
the Association. The evaluation process relates to the duties and 
responsibilities of the employee’s position, as set forth in the 
employee’s job description. 
I. 
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
The principal/head or school or assistant principal shall be 
responsible for the evaluation of the performance of all lunch 
hour monitors. 
A supervisor’s failure to address the job performance problems of 
their staff through the performance evaluation process 
represents unacceptable performance for which the supervisor 
will be held accountable. 
Further, a supervisor will also be performing unsatisfactorily if an 
underperforming staff member is given a satisfactory rating and 
then encouraged to transfer to another school or department. A 
supervisor who does this will be held accountable as part of their 
performance evaluation. 
At the end of each evaluation year, the Evaluator should retain 
copies of all evaluations and send the originals of all evaluations

to the Office of Human Resources. 
II. 
EVALUATION 
Preliminary Procedures 
At a reasonable time period after the start of the school year, the 
principal/assistant principal shall meet with the lunch hour 
monitors for the purpose of explaining the evaluation program 
and answering questions. The evaluation instrument will be 
reviewed during this meeting. 
After the evaluation has been presented to the employee, the 
signed evaluation form must be submitted to the Office of 
Human Resources.  
Interim Evaluations 
All lunch hour monitors shall receive an Interim evaluation at 
least once, or as required for the efficient running of the school. 
All interim evaluations should be conducted no earlier than 
February 1st each year. 
Annual Evaluations 
Annual evaluations must be completed no later than the last day 
of school each year. 
Evaluation Completion 
Every interim and annual evaluation must result in a mark for 
each appropriate item on the evaluation form. In any area where 
the supervisor indicates a need for improvement, they will 
provide the evaluee with a written prescription. The diagnosis 
and subsequent prescription should be fully descriptive and

instructive, suggesting specific remedies or recommendations 
for adoption by the evaluee. 
Evaluation Conference 
Within ten (10) school days following the completion of an 
evaluation, the evaluator shall meet with the evaluee for the 
purpose of discussing the evaluation. At this meeting, the 
evaluee will be shown their written evaluation and will sign it to 
indicate having seen it and to acknowledge that it will be placed 
in their personnel file, but not to indicate agreement or 
disagreement with the evaluation results. 
A copy of the evaluation shall be provided to the evaluee. The 
evaluee will be allowed to attach their comments to the 
evaluation. An evaluee whose overall performance has been 
judged unsatisfactory shall be notified in writing and shall meet 
directly with the evaluator.1 
III. RATINGS 
The performance evaluation process should provide each 
employee with an appraisal of their strengths and identify areas 
in need of improvement. The employee will be evaluated on each 
standard within the various categories. There are three possible 
ratings: 
 
E - EXCELLENT: 
The employee’s performance of the duties and 
responsibilities of their position exceeds

more information on this process.

expectations. 
S - SATISFACTORY: 
The employee’s performance of the duties and 
responsibilities of their position meets expectations. 
U - UNSATISFACTORY: The employee has failed to meet expectations and 
their performance of the duties and responsibilities of 
their position needs improvement. 
IV. PROCEDURES FOR UNSATISFACTORY EVALUATIONS 
If an evaluee receives an annual overall Unsatisfactory evaluation, 
plus an interim Unsatisfactory evaluation, the supervisor may 
initiate termination by recommending to the Superintendent 
that such employee be terminated. 
If the first evaluation is Unsatisfactory, it will be followed by a 
second evaluation no less than twenty-five (25) days in which the 
lunch monitor is present and no more than fifty (50) days in 
which the lunch monitor is present. 
If the second evaluation is Unsatisfactory, the lunch monitor will 
be given ten (10) school days to improve their performance. 
During these ten (10) school days following the second 
evaluation, the evaluator must informally evaluate the lunch 
monitor, but is not required to formally observe the employee or 
make any record of this evaluation. 
Should the lunch monitor’s performance not improve within the 
ten (10) days following an Unsatisfactory second evaluation, the 
monitor may be recommended for dismissal to the 
superintendent.

V. PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE 
If an Evaluator determines that an employee has committed an 
infraction of work rules such as excessive tardiness, absences, 
etc., the supervisor should follow the procedures outlined in the 
Superintendent's Circular on Employee Discipline Procedures.2 
Additionally, the supervisor should consider the infraction in 
evaluating the evaluee’s overall performance.
