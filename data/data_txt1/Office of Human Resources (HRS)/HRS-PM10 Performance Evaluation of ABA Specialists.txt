HRS-PM10 
Version 01 
 
 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF ABA SPECIALISTS 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version 
 
The following sets forth the coverage, philosophy, roles and 
responsibilities and procedures applicable to the evaluation 
process of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) specialists.  
I. COVERAGE 
The performance management process covers all ABA specialists. 
The evaluation process relates to the duties and responsibilities 
of the employee’s position, as set forth in the employee’s job 
description.  
II. PHILOSOPHY 
Performance management is one of the key processes driving 
the comprehensive reform of the Boston Public Schools. The 
performance management process for ABA specialists is 
designed to: (a) align the work of ABA specialists with the 
superintendent’s district wide priorities and with team goals and 
(b) improve the work performance of ABA specialists. 
III. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  
The performance management process for ABA specialists will 
be led by the assistant superintendent of special education, 


Page 2:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PM10 
Page 2 of 25 
 
 
assistant director for ABA, and program directors for ABA. ABA 
specialists will be evaluated by their immediate supervisors 
unless the assistant director designates another person to 
conduct the evaluation. 
A supervisor’s failure to address the job performance problems of 
their staff through the performance evaluation process 
represents unacceptable performance for which the supervisor 
will be held accountable. Further, a supervisor will also be 
performing unsatisfactorily if an underperforming staff member 
is given a “Proficient” rating and then the staff member is 
encouraged to transfer to another school or department. A 
supervisor who does this will be held accountable as part of their 
performance evaluation. 
IV. DIAGNOSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
The performance evaluation process should provide each 
employee with an appraisal of their strengths and identify areas 
in need of improvement. The employee will be evaluated on each 
standard within the various categories.  
There are four possible ratings: 1) Unsatisfactory; 2) Needs 
Improvement; 3) Proficient; and 4) Exemplary.  
V. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
Supervisors will conduct evaluations of their ABA specialists every 
year. The period for the performance evaluation for ABA 
specialists will cover September 1 – August 30 of the school year 
in which the employee is being evaluated. A supervisor may 
evaluate staff members more frequently if they choose to do so 
but must complete no fewer than 5 (five) direct observations over 


Page 3:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PM10 
Page 3 of 25 
 
 
the course of the school year.   
Supervisors are expected to provide timely written feedback to 
their staff members, especially for employees who, upon 
observation, are not meeting the expectations of the supervisor. 
An employee who is not meeting their supervisor’s expectations 
should have been informed of the supervisor’s concerns and 
provided recommendations for improvement through written 
feedback before the performance evaluation meeting and should 
be given a reasonable amount of time to address the observed 
deficient performance.  
Step 1 – REVIEW GOALS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
PLAN FOR THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR (September-October)   
Supervisors will meet individually with each of their ABA 
specialists to jointly review the employee’s goals and professional 
development plan for the September 1 - August 30 period. When 
possible, goal development should be done during the prior 
year’s performance evaluation meeting. 
During this meeting, the employee and their supervisor should 
review the employee’s job description to ensure the employee’s 
goals and professional development plans are in alignment with 
the job description.  
If there is a change in the employee’s goals and professional 
development plan after the prior year’s performance evaluation 
meeting, the revised goals and professional development plan 
must be documented.      


Page 4:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PM10 
Page 4 of 25 
 
 
Step 2 – PREPARE DIAGNOSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS (as 
needed)  
If at any time, including at the interim evaluation meeting (see 
step 3), a supervisor finds that an employee needs major 
improvement in their job performance or in accomplishing any 
goal, the supervisor will prepare a written diagnosis of the 
situation and make recommendations for improvement.   
The supervisor must share their written feedback with the 
employee within a reasonable amount of time, and thereafter 
should meet at least monthly with the employee to discuss their 
job performance. These meetings must be held until the 
employee’s job performance meets the supervisor’s expectations. 
If the employee’s job performance does not improve sufficiently, 
the employee may be separated from employment.   
Step 3 – COMPLETE STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND DATA CHECKS 
(September-May) 
As outlined in the ABA specialist evaluation, at least 5 (five) 
observations must be completed prior to the final performance 
evaluation in May. These observations must include direct 
observation of the ABA specialist performing essential job 
functions and working with students. The observations may or 
may not be announced and can occur at any time throughout 
the year. Following each observation session, the program 
director for ABA will provide written and vocal feedback to the 
ABA specialist outlining the strengths and areas of growth seen 
during the observation. 
As part of each observation, data checks and programming 
analyses will be conducted. These data checks will assess the 


Page 5:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PM10 
Page 5 of 25 
 
 
performance with programming and data entry for some portion 
of the time between observations. 
Step 4 – HOLD INTERIM EVALUATION MEETING (February-
March).  
ABA specialists will submit a formative self-assessment no later 
than February 10. This self-assessment will include the ABA 
specialist’s assessment of their work performance and feedback 
from previous observations to be incorporated into the interim 
evaluation. 
Supervisors will hold an interim evaluation meeting with each of 
their ABA specialists no later than March 1. During this meeting, 
the supervisor must give oral feedback on (1) the employee’s 
progress in achieving their goals, and (2) the employee’s overall 
job performance, especially with reference to the employee’s job 
description and customer focus. In addition, a written interim 
evaluation will be provided in a timely manner after the interim 
evaluation meeting. 
Step 5 – COMPLETE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION FORMS (May).  
The supervisor will prepare a performance evaluation on each 
ABA specialist each school year by filling out the Performance 
Evaluation Form – ABA Specialists attached at the end of this 
circular. 
 
 


Page 6:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PM10 
Page 6 of 25 
 
 
Step 6 – CONDUCT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION MEETING 
(June) 
 
The supervisor will meet with the employee to discuss their 
performance evaluation. The meeting will cover the employee’s 
job performance, their progress toward their annual goals, and 
their overall performance.  
During this meeting, based on the employee’s performance 
evaluation, the supervisor and employee should establish the 
employee’s goals for the coming school year. These goals should 
be tentative if the department’s (and team’s) goals have not been 
set. Similarly, the supervisor and employee should also discuss 
the employee’s professional development plan for the coming 
school year, with particular reference to the areas of growth or 
challenge identified in the performance evaluation.        
Step 7 – EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND RESPONSE 
The employee’s signature on the evaluation instrument 
acknowledges receipt, and not necessarily agreement with the 
content of the evaluation. The employee may provide a written 
response to the evaluation within 10 (ten) days of receiving the 
performance evaluation form. 
Step 8 – SUBMIT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION FORMS TO 
HUMAN RESOURCES (June)  
The supervisor will submit completed performance evaluation 
forms to Human Resources no later than June 1. Step increases 
are automatic.  


Page 7:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PM10 
Page 7 of 25 
 
 
Step 9 – FOLLOW UP FOR AN EMPLOYEE WHO RECEIVES AN 
“UNSATISFACTORY” RATING 
If an ABA specialist receives an “Unsatisfactory'' rating on their 
performance evaluation, the supervisor should meet with the 
employee at least monthly to discuss their job performance. 
These meetings must be held until the employee’s job 
performance meets the supervisor’s expectations. If the 
employee’s job performance does not improve sufficiently, the 
employee may be separated from employment.  
VII. PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE 
If a supervisor determines that an ABA specialist has committed 
an infraction of work rules, the supervisor should follow the 
procedures outlined in Superintendent’s Circular – Employee 
Discipline Procedures (see footnote below)1. Additionally, the 
supervisor may consider the infraction in evaluating the 
employee’s overall performance. 
VIII. FORMS 
The Performance Evaluation Form – ABA Specialists is attached.
