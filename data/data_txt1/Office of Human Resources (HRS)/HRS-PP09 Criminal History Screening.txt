CRIMINAL HISTORY SCREENING 
This policy circular shall remain in effect unless rescinded or 
replaced by a subsequent version. 
The Boston School Committee and superintendent are 
committed to providing a safe learning and work environment 
for Boston Public Schools students and employees. Following all 
applicable federal and state laws and regulations regarding 
Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI), including 
fingerprinting and Sex Offender Registry Information (SORI), it is 
the policy of the Boston Public Schools to conduct a criminal 
background check (“CORI check”) at least once every three (3) 
years on current and prospective employees, contracted service 
providers, volunteers, school transportation providers, and other 
individuals who may have direct and unmonitored contact with 
children.1 The Boston Public Schools criminal history screening 
policy applies to all current and prospective:  
a. full-time or part-time employees and candidates for 
employment, including promotions 
b. substitute employees 
c. student teachers, apprentices, and interns 
 
1 See also the Boston Public Schools Sexual Offender Registry 
Information (SORI) Policy.

d. employees of educational programs 
e. individuals who regularly provide school-related 
transportation to children 
f. contractors 
g. volunteers, subcontractors, and laborers who perform work 
in school buildings or on school grounds 2 
The Department of Criminal Justice Information Services (DCJIS) 
provides Boston Public Schools with “Required 2” access to CORI. 
Required 2 access produces a CORI record that includes all 
adult/youthful offender convictions, non-convictions, and 
pending offenses but does not list any sealed, juvenile, civil, or 
non-incarcerable crimes. The following practices and procedures 
are applicable when CORI and other criminal history checks, 
including fingerprint screening, are part of a general background 
check for employment or volunteer work in BPS. 
CONDUCTING CRIMINAL HISTORY (CORI AND FINGERPRINTING) 
SCREENING 
Criminal history checks, including CORI checks and fingerprint 
screenings, will only be conducted as authorized by the 
Department of Criminal Justice Information Services (DCJIS) 
under Mass. Gen. Laws c. 6, §§ 172 and 172B ½, c. 71, § 38R, 28 CFR 
20.33(a)(3), and Public Law 92‐544. Boston Public Schools will only 
perform a criminal history check after receiving a completed 
 
2 Volunteers, subcontractors, and laborers will not be subject to 
fingerprinting.

CORI/Fingerprinting Acknowledgement Form and confirming 
the individual’s identity. 
NOTE: BPS policy and procedures for criminal history checks 
including fingerprint screening are also subject to the 
regulations, policies, and procedures promulgated by the DCJIS 
and state board of elementary and secondary education. In 
accordance with those procedures, all candidates’ fingerprints 
will be searched against the Automated Fingerprint 
Identification System (AFIS) fingerprint database which is 
maintained by the Massachusetts State Police and the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Integrated Automated Fingerprint 
Identification System (IAFIS) fingerprint database. A fee will be 
required to conduct a fingerprint screen. 
In the instance that the Boston Public Schools requests an 
additional CORI Check from the DCJIS on an individual whose 
CORI has already been obtained within a year of signing the 
original CORI/Fingerprinting Acknowledgement Form, the 
individual will receive notice within 72 hours that it intends to 
conduct an additional CORI check. A current employee being 
considered for promotion must submit to a CORI check, 
regardless of whether a CORI check has been conducted within 
that year. 
ACCESS TO CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION (CORI AND 
FINGERPRINT SCREENING)  
All criminal history information obtained from the DCJIS is 
confidential, and access to the information must be limited to 
those individuals who have a “need to know.” This may include, 
but is not limited to, staff submitting the CORI requests and staff 


Page 4:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PP09 
Page 4 of 32 
 
members of the CORI/Criminal History Review Panel. The Boston 
Public Schools maintains and keeps a current list of each 
individual authorized to have access to, or view, a CORI and the 
results of a fingerprint screen. This list must be updated every six 
(6) months and is subject to inspection at any time only upon 
request by the DCJIS. 
CORI TRAINING  
The Boston Public Schools is an agency required to maintain a 
CORI Policy under Mass. Gen. Laws c. 6, §171A. Accordingly, all 
personnel authorized to conduct criminal history background 
checks or inspect CORI information will review and familiarize 
themselves with the educational and relevant training materials 
regarding CORI laws and regulations made available by the 
DCJIS.  
USE OF CRIMINAL HISTORY IN BACKGROUND SCREENING  
The Boston Public Schools shall only access, for employment 
purposes, the CORI and fingerprinting information for candidates 
who are otherwise qualified for the position for which they have 
applied and for current employees during periodic criminal 
background checks. 
Unless otherwise provided by law, a criminal record will not 
automatically disqualify an individual for employment, contract 
work, subcontract work, volunteering, or interning. Suitability 
determinations based on criminal background checks will be 
consistent with this policy and applicable laws or regulations.  
I. 
Verifying a Subject’s Identity  


Page 5:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PP09 
Page 5 of 32 
 
If a criminal record is received from the DCJIS, the information is 
to be closely compared with the information on the 
CORI/Fingerprinting Acknowledgement Form and any other 
identifying information provided by an individual to ensure the 
record belongs to the individual. 
If the information in the CORI record provided does not precisely 
match the identification information provided by the individual, a 
determination is to be made by a Boston Public Schools 
employee(s) authorized to make such determinations based on a 
comparison of the CORI record and documents provided by the 
individual.  
II. 
Inquiring About Criminal History  
In connection with any decision regarding employment, 
internships, or volunteer opportunities within the Boston Public 
Schools, the individual shall be provided with a copy of their 
criminal history record, whether obtained from the DCJIS or any 
other source, before asking the subject questions about their 
criminal history. The source(s) of the criminal history record is 
also to be disclosed to the subject.

III. 
Determining Suitability  
When an individual’s CORI record or fingerprint screen lists one 
or more offenses, the first step is to convene the CORI/Criminal 
History Review Panel. The panel will verify that the criminal 
record belongs to the individual and that the individual has not 
disputed the criminal record’s accuracy based on the procedure 
described in Section V of this policy.  
Findings from CORI Investigations – No Further Review – 
Outstanding Warrants 
1) If the CORI investigation reveals a conviction of a Table B 
crime that is a felony more than ten years old or a Table B 
crime that is a misdemeanor more than five years old, and 
there are no subsequent convictions or pending cases of 
any kind, the CORI/Criminal History Review Panel will not 
consider such crime. For purposes of computing the five- 
and ten-year periods, the period will run from the date any 
court supervision, probation, or sentence was terminated. 
2) If the CORI investigation reveals an outstanding warrant for 
any offense, the CORI/Criminal History Review Panel will 
inform the candidate that they are ineligible for 
employment unless the warrant is removed. 
3) Storage, retention, and destruction of all CORI reports, 
including those with a finding of “no record,” shall follow 
DCJIS regulations at 803 CMR 2.00: Criminal Offender 
Record Information (CORI).  
 
 
 


Page 7:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PP09 
Page 7 of 32 
 
Findings from CORI Investigation - Crimes Subject to Review 
1) If the CORI investigation reveals a conviction of a Table A 
crime, regardless of when it occurred, or a pending Table A 
crime, or a conviction of a Table B crime within the five- and 
ten-year periods or a pending Table B crime, the 
CORI/Criminal History Review Panel will carefully consider 
the following factors in its decision to hire or not hire the 
candidate: 
a. time since the conviction or pending offense 
b. age of the candidate at the time of the offense 
c. nature and specific circumstances of the offense 
d. the sentence imposed and the length of any period of 
incarceration 
e. relationship of the criminal act to the nature of the 
work to be performed 
f. number of offenses 
g. whether offenses were committed in association with a 
dependence on drugs or alcohol, from which the 
candidate has since recovered 
h. any relevant evidence of rehabilitation or lack thereof, 
such as information about compliance with conditions 
of parole or probation, including orders of no contact 
with victims and witnesses; and the individual’s 
conduct and experience since the time of the offense, 
including but not limited to educational or professional 
certifications obtained; and 


Page 8:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PP09 
Page 8 of 32 
 
i. any other relevant information, including information 
submitted by the candidate or requested by the 
CORI/Criminal History Review Panel. 
2) The CORI/Criminal History Review Panel, using a form 
prescribed by BPS, will also make a written determination of 
its decision to hire or not hire such candidate. This form will 
document the factors and rationale for the decision of the 
CORI/Criminal History Review Panel. A copy of such written 
determination will be maintained by the CORI/Criminal 
History Review Panel in a secure location, together with the 
CORI and criminal record disclosure information that may 
have been requested under this policy. 
Completion of the written determination form will serve to 
confirm that the CORI/Criminal History Review Panel has 
carefully reviewed the CORI and other relevant information, 
including information provided by the candidate, so that the 
vulnerable populations served by BPS are protected, and 
candidates with criminal histories are given a fair 
opportunity to be employed and to reintegrate successfully 
into the workforce. 
3) If the CORI/Criminal History Review Panel decides to hire a 
candidate with a CORI showing a conviction of or pending 
Table A crime, the CORI/Criminal History Review Panel will 
submit the prescribed form to the Chief Human Resources 
Officer, the Superintendent of Schools, or their designees. 
The CORI/Criminal History Review Panel will not proceed to 
hire the candidate for ten business days from the date the 
Chief Human Resources Officer or the Superintendent of 
Schools, or their designees receive the form. During such 
time, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the 


Page 9:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PP09 
Page 9 of 32 
 
Superintendent of Schools, or their designees may 
disapprove the hire or request additional information. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a CORI/Criminal History 
Review Panel may proceed to hire the candidate before the 
expiration of the five days if the Chief Human Resources 
Officer or the Superintendent of Schools or their designees, 
after receiving the prescribed form, informs the 
CORI/Criminal History Review Panel that they do not intend 
to disapprove the hire or request additional information. 
4) If the CORI/Criminal History Review Panel does not wish to 
hire a candidate with a Table A crime or a Table B crime 
within the five- and ten-year period, the prescribed form will 
be completed and maintained on file in a secure location. 
ADVERSE DECISIONS BASED ON CRIMINAL HISTORY 
INFORMATION (CORI AND FINGERPRINT SCREENING) 
If the Boston Public Schools is inclined to make an adverse 
decision based on criminal history background check results, the 
candidate will be notified immediately. The candidate shall be 
provided with a copy of the Boston Public Schools Criminal 
History Screening policy and their criminal history. The source(s) 
of the criminal history will also be revealed. The individual will 
then be provided with an opportunity to dispute the accuracy of 
the information. Individuals shall also be provided a copy of 
DCJIS’ Information Concerning the Process for Correcting a 
Criminal Record. The Boston Public Schools will stay the decision 
for a brief time and document the steps taken to comply with 
this procedure. 
SECONDARY DISSEMINATION LOGS  


Page 10:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PP09 
Page 10 of 32 
 
All CORIs obtained from the DCJIS are confidential and can only 
be disseminated as authorized under the applicable law and 
regulations. A central secondary dissemination log shall be used 
to record any dissemination of a CORI outside this organization, 
including dissemination at the individual’s request.  
CORI/CRIMINAL HISTORY REVIEW PANEL 
The Boston Public Schools CORI/Criminal History Review Panel 
shall consist of four or more of the following individuals: the 
Deputy Superintendent of Operations, the Chief Human 
Resources Officer, the Director of Transportation, the Director of 
Facilities, the Director of Labor Relations, the Director of Equity, 
or their designees. The panel, as well as the Superintendent, 
Legal Advisor, and Chief Operations Officer, shall all have access 
to criminal history information on a case-by-case basis as is 
necessary to perform their job functions. When reviewing an 
individual’s criminal history information to determine whether an 
individual is qualified for employment as a BPS employee or is 
qualified to work as a contractor, subcontractor, laborer, intern, or 
volunteer, the panel will review such factors as outlined in 
Section VII. The panel will determine whether an individual 
qualifies for employment or will commence work as a contractor, 
subcontractor, laborer, intern, or volunteer. The decision made by 
the CORI/Criminal History Review Panel shall be recorded and 
shall be made by a majority of members present. A minimum of 
four panel members must be present for a decision to be made. 
In the interests of confidentiality and the furtherance of the 
protection of school children, the identity of the panel reviewing 
a particular subject’s confidential criminal history will not be 
disclosed.

MISCELLANEOUS  
a) All individuals covered by the Boston Public Schools CORI 
Policy must submit an annual CORI Acknowledgment Form 
within ten days or following a request from the Office of 
Human Capital. 
b) A CORI Acknowledgment Form is valid for one year from the 
date the individual signs the form or until the conclusion of 
a subject’s employment, whichever comes first, and must be 
maintained for a minimum of one year from the date of 
execution. Within the year, the Boston Public Schools may 
submit an additional request for CORI but will first provide a 
72-hour written notice. If the individual objects to an 
additional CORI, the CORI Acknowledgment Form becomes 
invalid. However, the Boston Public Schools may make an 
adverse employment decision based on an individual’s 
objection to a request for CORI. Criminal history information 
will be maintained confidentially, on a need-to-know basis 
only, by the Office of Human Capital. A limited number of 
designated individuals will routinely review criminal history 
information. The Office of Human resourcesdesignee(s) will 
receive and maintain all properly obtained criminal history 


Page 13:

Page 13 of 32 
 
information and will keep the assistant superintendent of 
Human resourcesinformed.  
c) CORI information will remain segregated and secured from 
all personnel files or other personnel information. Hard 
copies will be stored in a locked, secured location. If the 
Boston Public Schools retains electronic copies of CORI 
reports, then the Boston Public Schools will password 
protect and encrypt the reports. The reports will not be 
maintained for more than seven (7) years after the 
employee’s last date of employment or after the final 
decision not to hire the candidate. 
d) For any adverse decision based on the criminal background 
check results, the individual will be notified immediately, 
either in person or by telephone, fax, email, or letter.  
e) CORI information may be used only to further the protection 
of children and for no other purpose. Access to such 
information shall be obtained in accordance with Mass. Gen 
Laws c. 6, §§167 to 168, inclusive. Improper use of CORI 
information is both a civil and a criminal offense and may 
subject an employee to discipline.
