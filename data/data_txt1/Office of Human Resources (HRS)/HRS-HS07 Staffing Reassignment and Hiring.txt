STAFFING, REASSIGNMENT AND HIRING OF 
PERMANENT AND PROVISIONAL TEACHERS 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
This circular outlines important dates and procedures regarding 
the staffing of schools for the 2023-2024 school year. Reflected in 
this circular are policies from the BPS-BTU Collective Bargaining 
Agreement, as well as information regarding the accelerated 
hiring timeline and hiring autonomy framework designed to 
enable all BPS schools to attract and hire the most diverse, 
qualified, and effective teachers as early as possible.  
Boston Public Schools and our school leaders are committed to 
building excellent schools that prepare our students to compete 
and succeed in the 21st century.  To cultivate world-class, global 
citizens, we commit to recruiting, retaining, and promoting a 
diverse, highly qualified, and effective workforce. 
As an urban district with an increasingly diverse student body, it 
is also imperative that schools fully comply with the Final 
Judgment of the Federal Court dated July 1994 that requires 
district and examination schools to employ a minimum of 25% 
Black teachers and staff and 10% other minority teachers.

In addition, one of our continuous hiring goals is to increase our 
number of bilingual teachers and staff to support our English 
Language Learner populations. We urge school leaders to take 
every possible step to help each school, and the district as a 
whole, to meet these mandates and goals.

I. DETERMINATION OF SCHOOL STAFFING NEEDS 
Timeframe: November to February 
Every fall, schools develop budget and staffing plans for the 
following year based on each school’s projected enrollment. 
Once a school’s estimated budget is established, the process 
known as Probable Organization (“Probable Org”) begins, in 
which schools, together with representatives from the Office of 
Human Resources, identify their staffing plans for the upcoming 
school year.  
Several components make up the Probable Organization process: 
ANNUAL BUDGET COLLABORATIVE AND PROBABLE 
ORGANIZATION PROCESS

II. POSTING OF TEACHING POSITIONS 
The staffing process for the 2023-2024 school year includes a 
hiring timeline designed to facilitate attracting and hiring the 
most diverse, qualified, and effective teachers as early as possible.   
Personnel Subcommittee 
Schools must ensure that the Personnel Subcommittee of the 
School Site Council is formed and ready to begin the hiring 
process by March 1. Schools must submit a complete roster of 
Personnel Subcommittee members to the Office of Family and 
Student Engagement by the end of October. Training related to 
personnel subcommittees are offered by the Office of Family and 
Student Engagement, the BTU, and the Office of Human 
Resources. Details about the personnel subcommittee can be 
found in Superintendent’s Circular FAM-04. 
Process  
Hiring early will ensure that schools are able to secure the most 
qualified candidates. Positions will be posted on TalentEd in early 
March once Probable Org and determination of vacancies have 
been concluded. Teachers who wish to apply for a position 
effective the first day of school for the upcoming school year 
must apply for postings online through TalentEd. Current BPS 
teachers may apply for any position for which they are qualified. 
Applicants who wish to be considered for inclusion in the district 
priority pool must submit their applications for the priority pool 
through TalentEd by March 1, 2024. Candidates for the priority 
pool will undergo a competency-based phone and resume 
screening process coordinated by the Office of Recruitment, 
Cultivation, and Diversity. 


Page 7:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-HS07 
Page 7 of 27 
 
 
All approved hires will become effective on the first day of work 
for the upcoming school year. Any teacher who accepts a new 
position is not eligible to apply for any additional teaching jobs 
for the 2024-2025 school year. Beginning July 1, 2023, OHC will no 
longer approve lateral hires to prevent unanticipated vacancies 
late in the hiring season.  
Hiring Approval  
The Boston Public Schools is committed to recruiting, retaining, 
and promoting a highly qualified, culturally, and linguistically 
diverse workforce that reflects the rich diversity of our students 
and positively impacts both academic and non-academic student 
learning outcomes. The Office of Equity, Office of Human 
Resources, and school superintendents will establish an 
accountability process to ensure that reasonable efforts have 
been made to hire teachers that move schools and the district 
toward meeting our workforce diversity goals. 
Candidates hired must be qualified and meet diversity hiring 
requirements: 
• Teachers hired must hold valid licensure for the position. 
• Teachers hired must move the school toward meeting or 
maintaining district diversity goals. 
• School hiring teams must complete reference checks. 
Heads of school or principals and School Site Council Personnel 
Subcommittees should also be sure to interview qualified 
excessed permanent teachers.

Page 9 of 27 
 
 
every spring. Information on the specific date and time will be 
shared in the BTU bulletin. 
III. EXCESSING 
Voluntary and Involuntary Reassignment/Excess 
A. Voluntary Excessing – Teachers and Paraprofessionals 
Deadline:  February 1, 2024 
All permanent teachers or paraprofessionals who meet the 
Voluntary Excessing eligibility criteria as outlined in the 
Collective Bargaining Agreement (1) including those on 
leave of absence, may voluntarily request excessing 
regardless of whether there is a reduction in the number of 
positions. Teachers and paraprofessionals who voluntarily 
excess themselves forfeit their rights to the position they 
have left.  
Voluntary Excessing Requirements for Teachers:  
● The teacher must hold permanent status.  
● The request must be submitted to OHC by February 1, 2024 
(see instructions below). 
● The teacher must possess an overall rating of Proficient or 
higher on their most recent evaluation, which includes the 
Formative Assessment. 
 
(1) Refer to the Collective Bargaining Agreement (September 1, 
2018 – August 31, 2021) pp. 76-77 for a list of requirements for 
teachers and pp. 136 for paraprofessionals. 


Page 10:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-HS07 
Page 10 of 27 
 
 
● The teacher may not have voluntarily excessed themselves 
within the prior two years. 
 
Teachers and paraprofessionals who wish to request 
excessing should submit their Application for Reassignment 
or complete ATTACHMENT 1, Application for Reassignment, 
and submit it to their head of school or principal as well as 
the Office of Human Resources by February 1, 2024.  The 
Office of Human Resources will review all applications and 
inform teachers or paraprofessionals and the school of the 
results of the request. Teachers and paraprofessionals who 
do not meet the above criteria will not be approved for 
voluntary excessing. Requests for voluntary excessing can 
be rescinded up until February 9, 2024. Approved requests 
are considered binding after that date. 
B. Involuntary Reassignment/Excessing 
Deadline: All involuntarily excessed teachers and nurses will 
be notified on or before April 15, 2024.  
To stay in a current position, permanent educators must 
hold the appropriate license(s) for the role to which they are 
assigned; otherwise, the educator will be excessed. 
 
Additionally, it may be necessary to excess permanent 
teachers if there is a reduction in the number of teaching 
positions for the following school year, a school is identified 
for closure, or the Massachusetts Department of Education 
designates it as Level 4 school. When a reduction in the 
number of positions occurs, involuntary excessing will be 


Page 11:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-HS07 
Page 11 of 27 
 
 
first by volunteers in a program area, then by reverse 
seniority within a program area unless: 
a. A teacher with more seniority voluntarily requests to be 
excessed; or, 
b. The excessing of the least junior teacher would prohibit 
compliance with U.S. District Court Order dated July 
1994. 
Schools with specific types of staffing autonomy may also 
involuntarily excess teachers. The school’s ability to 
involuntarily excess teachers must be included in the 
school’s governing document.  
Placement in Positions of Suitable Professional Capacity 
Permanent teachers who are not hired into vacant positions 
will be assigned in a suitable professional capacity in 
accordance with the BPS/BTU contract.  
IV. STAFFING FOR PROVISIONAL TEACHERS 
A. Reasonable Assurance for Provisional Teachers 
First and second-year provisional teachers may be eligible to 
receive reasonable assurance that they will continue in their 
current position for the following school year. Provisional 
teachers must hold a valid DESE license(s) for the position in 
which they are teaching in order for a Letter of Reasonable 
Assurance to be granted. No exceptions will be made.  
In addition to budgetary and licensure concerns, a teacher’s 
performance, as measured through the Massachusetts 
Regulations on Evaluation of Educators (603 CMR 35.00), is a 
major factor in determining whether a provisional teacher 
receives a Letter of Reasonable Assurance. Principals and 


Page 12:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-HS07 
Page 12 of 27 
 
 
heads of school will be held accountable for ensuring that all 
provisional teachers receive a Formative Assessment, which 
includes an overall rating, by February 1, 2024. Provisional 
teachers who have not been evaluated will not be eligible to 
receive a Letter of Reasonable Assurance. 
During Probable Organization, school leaders will work with 
OHC to identify all provisional teachers who are eligible to 
receive reasonable assurance, listing them in their Probable 
Organization template. OHC will send letters of Reasonable 
Assurance by April 15 to provisional teachers. 
Requests for permanent appointment for current 
Provisional 1 and Provisional 2 teachers will not be granted. 
See section IV.A below for information regarding Provisional 
3 teachers and the awarding of permanent status. 
B. Permanent Appointment of Provisional Teachers 
Eligibility 
The Massachusetts Regulations on Evaluation of Educators 
stipulate that achievement of Professional Teaching Status 
(being made a permanent teacher in BPS) is dependent 
upon receiving a rating of Proficient or above on all four of 
the Standards of Effective Teaching Practice, as well as an 
overall rating of Proficient or Exemplary. See below for 
additional criteria required for permanent status.  


Page 13:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-HS07 
Page 13 of 27 
 
 
A school leader may recommend an educator (2) for 
permanent appointment (3) if they meet all the following 
criteria:   
● The teacher is provisional, and in their third year at BPS. 
● The teacher received a rating of Proficient or Exemplary 
overall and on all four Standards of Effective Teaching on 
a Formative Assessment, released by February 1, 2024. 
● The teacher will remain in the same position in their 
current school for the 2023-24 school year.  
● The teacher holds a valid DESE license(s) for the content 
area in which they are teaching. 
● The teacher holds either an ESL license or SEI 
Endorsement (Core content teachers of ELLs as required 
by DESE) or a Bilingual Educator Endorsement (BEE), 
should the BEE be requirement by their position. 
Please note: While the head of school or principal may 
recommend a Provisional 3 teacher for permanent status 
based upon fulfillment of the criteria above, the teacher may 
not be granted permanent status until a Summative 
 
(2) Educators considered teachers and eligible for Professional 
Teacher Status as defined by M.G.L. c.71 § 41 include teachers, 
school librarians, school adjustment counselors, school nurses, 
school social workers, or school psychologists.  
(3) A school leader may make the recommendation for 
permanent appointment when the educator is still in their third 
year to take effect on the first day of their fourth year. 


Page 14:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-HS07 
Page 14 of 27 
 
 
Evaluation is released which indicates Proficient or 
Exemplary practice overall in all four standards.  
If a Provisional 3 teacher does not achieve a rating of 
Proficient or Exemplary overall on all four standards on their 
Formative Assessment, they may be required to take a one-
year break in service. During the break in service, the 
teacher would not be eligible for employment as a teacher 
or substitute within Boston Public Schools. After the year-
long break in service, the teacher would once again be 
eligible for vacant teaching positions, and, if hired, would 
return to Provisional 1 status.  
Process 
To recommend a Provisional 3 teacher for Permanent 
Appointment during Probable Organization, the head of 
school or principal must take the following steps:  
1) Release the teacher’s Formative Assessment by January 
12, 2024 
2) Identify the position that the teacher will hold for the 
2023-24 school year 
3) Record the recommendation for Permanent 
Appointment on the Provisional Review Process page in 
FutureForce Version 2  
 
If, upon the principal or head of school’s release of the end-
of-year Summative Evaluation, the provisional teacher has 
successfully demonstrated effective teaching practice(s) by 
achieving a rating of Proficient or Exemplary overall and on 


Page 15:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-HS07 
Page 15 of 27 
 
 
all four standards of effective teaching, they will become 
permanent as of September 2023. 
V. LEAVES OF ABSENCE 
A. Planning to Take a Leave of Absence in 2024-2025 
Deadline: January 15, 2024 
Permanent teachers who are not currently on leave but 
are planning to take a Leave of Absence during the 2024-
2025 school year (e.g., personal reasons, education), must 
submit a leave application by January 15, 2024. 
Employees must submit a request for leave electronically 
via Employee Self-Service. Employees should submit 
applications even if they have not officially been accepted 
for a job and educational program but are in the 
application process. If a teacher is not accepted into a 
graduate program or job, the leave request can be 
rescinded, so long as the Office of Human Resources is 
notified by April 1. 
For further information regarding leaves of absences, 
including how to apply, please refer to Superintendent’s 
Circular HRS-HS-PP13.   
 
 
 


Page 16:
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-HS07 
Page 16 of 27 
 
 
B. Currently on a Leave of Absence  
Deadline: January 15, 2024 
In November 2023, teachers currently on non-medical leave 
will be sent a letter informing them about the expiration of 
their leave. The teacher must submit the response form that 
accompanies the letter to the Office of Human Resources, 
stating their request to extend their leave/intent to remain 
on their leave or return from leave by January 15, 2024. If the 
teacher does not respond by the deadline, they will forfeit 
rights to their position.  
The leave letters are sent to the address listed on the Hub. 
Employees are responsible for ensuring that this address is 
correct. For further information regarding leaves of 
absences, please refer to Superintendent’s Circular HRS-
PP13, Absence and Leave Policy.   
VI. HIRING OF INTERNATIONAL TEACHERS 
International teachers are not legally permitted to work or 
to be paid without proof of official United States Citizenship 
& Immigration Services (USCIS) work authorization. Heads of 
school, principals, or RC managers should make it a 
common practice to inquire about the work authorization 
status of all their potential new hires.
