NUMBER: 
HRS-PP15 
Version 01 
SICK LEAVE DONATION PROGRAM 
This circular will remain in effect unless rescinded or superseded 
by a subsequent version. 
Boston Public Schools will be continuing the Sick Leave Donation 
Program with Administrative Guild, BASAS, BTU, managerial, and 
School Police Patrolmen's Association. 
PURPOSE 
The Sick Leave Donation Program is a voluntary program where 
eligible employees can donate sick leave hours to help a seriously 
ill or injured colleague who has exhausted their sick, personal, 
vacation, and/or compensatory leave entitlements. An eligible 
employee who wants to withdraw hours from the Sick Leave 
Bank must be on an approved leave of absence. Please refer to 
Superintendent’s Circular HRS-PP13 for more information 
regarding the process to apply for a leave of absence. If time is 
awarded by the Sick Leave Donation Committee, recipients can 
withdraw sick leave hours from the leave bank and maintain 
active pay status. 
Membership and eligibility requirements by unit are detailed in 
the attachment. 
THE DONATION PROCESS 
When the sick leave bank for a union/group becomes depleted,

donation of an additional day(s). All employees who wish to enroll 
will be required to complete an online form during the 
aforementioned period.  All donations are irrevocable.               
SICK LEAVE COMMITTEE 
The leave committee for each union/group will consist of six 
members: three administrative members from the union/group 
and three administrative members from the Boston Public 
Schools district (appointed by the superintendent or their 
designee). A majority vote (4 of 6) is required to grant awards of 
sick leave time. All decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.

form, including submission of medical documentation and a 
letter stating the reason for the request in accordance with 
the application deadline listed on the form.

pertinent information. Committee will render a decision and 
Human Capital will inform the employee and supervisor of 
the decision.  
3. If approved, the Office of Human Capital representative will 
add donated hours to the recipient’s leave accrual balance 
in PeopleSoft.  
4. Withdrawals from the leave bank cease when the recipient 
has either returned to work or withdrawn the maximum 
number of hours allotted from their union or conditions of 
employment.       
There is no appeal procedure. The decision of the Sick Leave
